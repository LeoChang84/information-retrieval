Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	Aunt Polly, my family and I did it. Yes, even if you check with DHL or Fedex, they know it, and they know what to do. But you'll have to complete your papers adn plan your trip well, as the processing takes (max) of 5 working days in all. Yes, you'll need a separate Schengen Visa for those countries you mentioned (except Holland). The 15 Schengen countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. All these countries except Norway and Iceland are European Union members. When you know your 1st Schengen-visa valid country, that will be your visa application. Say, your 1st destination before or after Swiss is Italy, then you have to get your Schengen Visa from the Italian Embassy here. Once you have the visa, you can roam around 15 countries!

Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	You do not mention what passport you hold. Either way your travel agent should have arranged everything for you. I would be VERY hesitant to travel anywhere in teh world if I did not know what the visa requirements were for a particular country. On the other hand the airline carrying you to Qatar would ultimately be responsible for you and will not allow you to board if your paperwork is not in order. Check out the Qatar Government websites if you have the opportunity. Good Luck.	0	Q388	Q388_R28_C1

Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	I too was worried about the new visa regulations about having 5000 riyals or valid international credit card and hotel voucher upon arrival, as I have relatives coming out here in 2 weeks time. (Family and they are regular visitors). I have been told by other people who have had visitors arrive that it's no problem .. still the same as before 55 riyals for 3 week visa on arrival (with option of renewing for the extra week at 50QR).

Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	My parents have only ever visited here with Emirates Airlines. They have been 3 times now and have had no problems whatsoever. However, these new regulations have come in to effect ... but as mentioned, speaking to people who had just had visitors they have had no problems and wasn't asked to provide anything. If you are a bit nervous ... you can get your friends to organise a meet and greet service for you. You can book them at any Qatar Airways office ... doesn't matter what airline you are arriving in. Costs around 70 riyals (can't remember exactly) and they will meet you when you get off the plane, seat you in a room with refreshments then organise your visa .. you can pay a bit extra (10 riyals) and they will even pick up your luggage for you and escort you thru customs It's a great service, especially if you are unsure or nervous. Good luck.	0	Q388	Q388_R28_C7
Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	So ask Emirates. They're required by law to make sure they're not carrying undesirable aliens, so it's in their interest to make sure everything's in order. I'm pretty sure you'll be OK so long as you can persuade immigration that you're a bona-fide short term tourist, which is why a hotel booking is recommended. It might help to have ask your friends for their job details, address & RP number. (They'll know what that is.) If you're at all young or attractive, they'll be suspicious that you might be a prostitute. Note that in all these respects, it's exactly the same for non-EC tourists entering the UK or Brits entering the USA.	0	Q388	Q388_R28_C8
Can someone suggest a link or explain how to obtain visas for family hoping to go on vacation to The UK and Spain? We are bona fide residents in Qatar by the way. Thank you	I have read these comments and decided to join! This is the first time for me planning to visit some country in the region of the Middle East and I thought it would be better if I get all the needed info in advance. The problem is that I am not sure what kind of visa should I be obtained, as a southeastern European citizen (but still not in the EU), during the visit that I have planned for upcoming December. My girlfriend is employed by a certain company in Doha for past two months and Iâ€™d be staying at her flat for about 3 weeks. I've heard it is almost illegal being at apartment of a woman with a â€˜singleâ€™ marital status! Is this possible??

It just pop in my mind, Maybe your bank just have the card block, and they need to lift it. That is just another option. One time in Kenya , my bank block it, because they tought soemone stole it.

My husband is trying to apply for a family visa ; for me. Can anybody show me a format of the RENT AGREEMENT needed for the same? Or advice on where to get the same..	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q389	Q389_R28_C4

My husband is trying to apply for a family visa ; for me. Can anybody show me a format of the RENT AGREEMENT needed for the same? Or advice on where to get the same..	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q389	Q389_R28_C10

My husband is trying to apply for a family visa ; for me. Can anybody show me a format of the RENT AGREEMENT needed for the same? Or advice on where to get the same..	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

NOC IS No Objection Certificate and releasing an employee that way and applying for another maid visa will be difficult for you as the Labor ministry will question about why have you given a release to an already approved visa, and then applied for the same post.The best procedure for you , [if you intend to bring another maid that is] is to cancel the visa, sent her home and reapply for a maid visa,you also need to provide evidence about the status of your previous maid visa.	0	Q390	Q390_R12_C4

Minoush, if you are not satisfied with her, you can give her the option of looking for another job here in Doha, someone who can sponsor her, and then give her the release and let her go, this way she doesn't stay without a job. For this she can place an ad looking for a job with a willing sponsor. She will surely get one. You can also send her back home as well if you are not satisfied with her work.you are not compelled to keep her, just make sure that she is paid all her dues, but to be on the safer side, check what your contract with her states and do the right thing.	0	Q390	Q390_R12_C10

Looking to release my housemaid; and give her an NOC. How do I do this; do I have to cancel her visa first or afterwards; does she have to be in the Qatar for this?	Exactly! they should not charge you any penny as she already worked with them for 4 years! If they send her home, you cannot hire her directly without an NOC she has to wait for another 3 years before she can enter Qatar again. In that sense, there's no way you can avoid paying the QR6,000. If you are going to hire from the agencies you will find out eventually that, you will spend more or less the same amount! If your instinct say she's worth it, then go for it! but if you find it too expensive, as I said there are lots of them looking for job who are already there, it will suit you according to your budget! ;)	0	Q390	Q390_R16_C7

Looking to release my housemaid; and give her an NOC.

HOWEVER , THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities, they will no longer issue you an NOC letter, and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.	0	Q390	Q390_R19_C2

As far as i know, You need to get a NOC letter from your employer, which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary, and the nationality of the maid you want to get. Take this to the labour department on C-ring road (i guess), there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC. Will take atleast a week for the approval to come.

Looking to release my housemaid; and give her an NOC.

Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance, so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else, marry there, but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar, and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid, something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta, that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier, since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage, but at least you can be in Qatar, near him.	0	Q390	Q390_R55_C7

If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way, apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification, now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit. Some times Free visa holders stuck in this country and you may never meet your sponsor after you arrive in this country and may not get Exit permit to go for vacation or Emergency situation.	0	Q390	Q390_R57_C8

Because when your wife go to hospital for check up and when she will deliver the baby in the hospital, the hospital will ask you to submit the marriage certificate. when you will register to have a Birth Certificate at the Supreme Council for Health they will again ask for the marriage certificate and when you will apply for your baby visa, they will not require for a NOC, just the baby passport, you and your wife passport and RP ID.	0	Q390	Q390_R69_C8

You won't get an approval if your husband's salary is below 10,000...the reason behind it is you cannot live comfortably if your whole family is with you, and the head of the family earning only 5,000. Way back 2007, the limit is minimum 7,000...2010 onwards, they raised it to 10,000 due to higher cost of living. You cannot add wife's salary to make the 10,000...	0	Q391	Q391_R17_C8

Is it possible to sponsor husband? Is possible; then can he able to work in Qatar?	"1. Your husband has to check if he can acquire a visa for a maid under his name. 2. He has to apply for that visa. 3. The maid has to be different from your nationality.(that's I am not sure if still the current law) 4. Once your husband has been approved for his application to sponsor a maid, he then can get the visa transfer form. 5. He has to ask your father to sign it and your maid to sign it. 6. Your father has to make a release letter for your maid 7. You can submit those papers to the Immigration. I hope the above could help you, I am no immigration expert here, I just read those previou thread and gather the above informations from it. I am not sure also, how long it will take (the processing) Goodluck! Cheers!

They did have many trousers, price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.	0	Q392	Q392_R24_C1

Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&S does not have a Maternity section.

Morning! Anyone knows where to find a tailor shop near or within Al Sadd area; that sew or repairs trousers/jeans? For children's school upcoming parties. Any help would be great. Cheers!	I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online, shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

Morning! Anyone knows where to find a tailor shop near or within Al Sadd area; that sew or repairs trousers/jeans? For children's school upcoming parties. Any help would be great. Cheers!	hi Minoush, you will have to go to Mothercare at CC, because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC, if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya, so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas, more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now, with lycra tights, so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue, as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style, is the low bump style right now, and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes, else you may have to try the large clothes section, like Evans, if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well, they dont have maternity, but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.	0	Q392	Q392_R24_C5

"my few experience : 1) I had noise on my Honda steering, plus steering was hard, i visited one mechanic in industrial area, he asked for QAR 400 for fixing... then i went to another mechanic, he asked for QAR 1500 ! said, i need to replace the entire unit including some belts (?)... then i went to third mechanic, and he found it was nothing... just power steering oil was to fill. and he fixed it in just 2 minutes and i was very happy to pay him QAR 50. my cost was dropped from 1500 to 50 Riyals ! 2) another incident, the vehicle was giving noise while putting in reverse gear. I went to the same mechanic who earlier had fixed steering problem just in 2 minute, and he asked for some checkup in German Computer. I did the checkup and computer gave an error code with description ""reverse solenoid blaa blaa blaa"". I presented the report to him, he said, the gearbox has to open and replace some switch inside and asked for the spare part from Honda + 500 Riyals for labour charge and 2 days time for fixing. I just thought to see another mechanic also. I went to another mechanic (auto electrician), he checked the code and said, there is loose connection or cable broken somewhere... he fixed the car in less than 30 minutes and asked for 100 Riyals only ! 3) least but not last case... recently, after changing the engine oil, the low oil pressure signal started to flash. i visited an mechanic, he said it's electrical issue and referred me to one of his fried. i went there, he checked the car and said the oil pump is dead. i need to get the new oil pump + chain + silicon plus the labour charge will be 400 QAR around. I again was in search of some good and cheap mechanic this time too. so i visited 2-3 mechanics.. finally i found one, who found there is no oil pump issue. just need to clean the filter looking thing inside the chamber. He did that and the problem is solved in just 100 QAR again ! I don;t know how many problems i am gonna have in my car in future and how many crazy mechanic i will have to face. but after all, i can confidently say that, there is no honest mechanic in this city ! you have to check with 3-4 mechanic at least. or take your vehicle to authorized service center who definitely will charge you a lot !"	0	Q392	Q392_R25_C8

You can fill in all the documents on your own - look for the Canadian embassy in Kuwait in Google and you will find all that you need there. Unless you have lots of money, skills that are in demand (and papers to prove your qualifications), or are a refugee, it is very difficult to get in to Canada. It can take years for the papers to get through so if someone has told you 10 months, that is probably completely unrealistic.	0	Q393	Q393_R18_C6

Hi frfs did any ine recently done the IELTS exam in Qatar. hw is the exam which center is better .lkz give ur valuable tips im going to write academic module in coming days	Hi Papu21, Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha, we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question, yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa, if you are worried about fires. Re health, we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors, all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open, on your own or with your child, in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving, I find that there is hardly any road courtesy, lots of big cars, high speed, they change lanes with no indication at all and very car horn trigger-happy here. Qataris are generally gentle polite people. Although they are a minority in Qatar's population, most people I've met here are friendly, helpful and generally nice people too.	0	Q393	Q393_R23_C8

Hi frfs did any ine recently done the IELTS exam in Qatar. hw is the exam which center is better .lkz give ur valuable tips im going to write academic module in coming days	Hello, I'm an american here on a fellowship to study Arabic at Qatar University. Unfortunately it is too late to enroll in classes there and class sizes are usually pretty big. I, however, have been studying Arabic for a long time and am basically fluent, I'm here to perfect my language skills. If you are looking for a private tutor I am available everyday after 2pm. My Arabic is quite good and as a non-native speaker I'm very familiar with how non-natives learn the language. I have teaching experience. if you are interested please email me. amyrusky@gmail.com Hope to hear from you Amy	0	Q393	Q393_R37_C1

Hi frfs did any ine recently done the IELTS exam in Qatar. hw is the exam which center is better .lkz give ur valuable tips im going to write academic module in coming days	Amy, thank you for your answer. I however would prefer a native speaker. The reason being is that if I will start learning Arabic with you, I will inevitably acquire your accent, and this is something I would like to avoid.

Hi frfs did any ine recently done the IELTS exam in Qatar. hw is the exam which center is better .lkz give ur valuable tips im going to write academic module in coming days	Salam, Hello, Bonjour, Hola & Oi !! To all those who were looking for possible Arabic tutoring by a native speaker . . . I am a native speaker from Palestine. I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States, whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans, Mexicans, Brasilians, Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner, intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting, i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise, if you are interested, you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether. Plus, I make the tutoring process an enjoyable(non-boring) experience for both me and the student. In the Beginner level, all students need to know about certian things. But in the intermediate, things can go in different directions depending on the person and what he or she wants and for how long. There is the formal Arabic and there is the dialect. The major dialects in the Arab world are: (1)North African(Morocco, Algeria and Morocco), (2)Laventine (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan),(3)Iraq, (4)Gulf and (6)Egypt/Sudan. The Laventine and the Egyptian dialects are the ones under demand the most of students who seek to explore the world of the Arabic language. The first meeting or session is always free since it is important for the student to know what he or she is about to learn. This may include some grammar and background about the language, the regions and the different dialects. Being native Arabic, fluent in English(Reading and writing) and backgrounds in Spanish and French helped me alot in dealing with the different students according to their backgrounds and ways of thinking when it comes to learning a new language. Sometime, I used refereces from German, Dutch and Portogese to explain something about Arabic to make things clearer. My fares are not cheap, but they are not expensive at all. But my fares are very fair both for the student and me. I can tutor person to person but for those who want to set up a group to have better savings, it is better not to have more 4 people. For me, it does not matter, but I do not want you to loose the benefit of having a small group. At the end, I am getting paid but you will learn less in a larger group and it will be more headache for me, LOL! This is not my main line of work, of course! But it has always been my work in my space or spare or leisure time as well. BUT BUT BUT - IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A NATIVE SPANISH SPEAKER(either from Spain or Latin America), then you have an advantage. I am willing to switch lessons for free if that is fine with the person. An hour in Arabic for an hour in return in Spanish because since I moved here, I am afraid I am starting to loose my background in Spanish, which I try not to. In order to keep it and improve it . . . then as they say in Spanish: Necessitas dos para tango en cada aspecto de la vida! y la lingua es un exemplo muy bueno! Gracias! If you have msn chatting, you can instant message me and hopefully I will be online to write you back. Excuse me for being long but it is nice to be informed in advance. So, who is interested, feel free to contact me for further information and/or clarifications. Yalla . . . regards and best of luck for you all . . .	0	Q393	Q393_R37_C9

How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share.

Latest news is that a memo was circulated last week that bans the stewardesses for doing anything than staying at home when on standby, and that they need to get 12 hours of rest before each flight. This leaves them without a social life. The administration and and management treat everyone like garbage - in Europe this would be impossible but here its the way it is, they can always get some more Indians or Easter European. In the lastest 6 months 25 - 33 % of the staff has resigned or been fired so they always need new people.

How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share. Thanks	So to answer the question, i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former, best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter, then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha), she didn't travel till she was 6 months old, but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it.

How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share. Thanks	Airlines...I have traveled by Qatar Airways, Gulf Airways, Air India. Of which I would Rate Air India above QA & GA. In fact the most comfortable was Jet Airways (previously it was National carrier now its gone International and has flights from Doha-India-Doha). I would have to say Jet was the best with Leather Seats, nice leg space, good service et all...(Jet's service is legendary in India) In QA & GA both, my knees were continously touching the front seat & was very uncomfortable. It felt almost as if I was travelling in a Bus...lol Sevice wise I guess all were as good (QA with Filipino staff were good too), But the comfort of the Seat and the Leg space would be the most prized by me.	0	Q394	Q394_R25_C10
How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share. Thanks	Cactiflora... if you want my advice, try etihad airlines of the UAE. They are newer and you have much more opportunities. If you are experienced you will make cabin manager within a couple of years. Its true that QR pay a little more than etihad but etihad just recently raised their duty allowance to abou US$150 per day. You are also given the option of taking cash instead of accommodation and transport. But the overriding factor, in my opinion, is that QR is awful when it comes to customer service and this reputation is spreading.	0	Q394	Q394_R28_C1

How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share. Thanks	One of the worst international airlines in the world, in my opinion, for customer care. I think they were voted best airline by business travellers, not the general public. In business or first, your treated like royalty because thats where airline industry votes usually come from. But fly in cattle class and its a different story. I think the strategists for this airline should be told what a poor service they are providing to the general flying public. Only reason they are popular is because they are cheap (for economy) and they have a virtual monopoly on doha airport.	0	Q394	Q394_R28_C6

How is the Qatar Airways direct flight experience from Doha To Nagpur; how is the flight &#38; service experience; any body got the experienced; please share. Thanks	QA flies non stop from Doha to more destinations then any other airline. Skytrax has voted QA cabin attendants best in middle east and 2nd best in the world. It is a comparatively young airline, mistakes are made in process but comfort of non stop travel and frequency that QA has is a great service for residents of Qatar. I was flying with BA on a 8 hr transatlantic flight and I had made special request for food (they were advised week in advance) but guess what no food, had to eat peanuts for more then 8 hours.. Does that mean BA is a bad airline, no its not but these things happens. All airlines have issues with delays and all are working hard to minimize them, QA has better on time performance than many big name airlines. I hope your next flight with QA is on time, if not then call airliner (Qatarliving Member) he works for QA I think Beast666	0	Q394	Q394_R28_C8

Aslo, the term thin vs the term slender is not really a gramatical infrigement (although I do agree with you that it may have been more appropriate under the current circumstances). Stay safe.

Dear friends; I have lost my cat near my house in South Duhail- Umm Lakhba. QR 500 for anyone who finds her. Please call 66414460 if found. Thanks	Alyson, you can get Royal Canin for cats here, I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians, they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest, if you use an enclosed litter box, bring one with you, as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys, they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh, and frontline is also quite expensive here, and I haven't found the specific one for cats, the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway, those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.	0	Q395	Q395_R61_C4

The d-ring and industrial roundabout have been closed for a very long time here. In the same time, Dubai has built roads, bridges and highways to wrap Doha several times over. Construction boom in Doha? You got to be kidding! Check out the real boom in Dubai. Career opportunities? Dubai of course. Lifestyle and going out? Dubai. Having fun? Dubai. Driving? Dubai of course.

Where you will get pani puri in qatar???	Buying supplements in qatar can be frustating because of limited sellers and really high price. GNC is crap as they sell standard stuff and overcharge. Try Top Sports in Al Nasser area very close to Family Food Center, they are selling Optimum Nutrition and Nitrotech stuff, or you can visit some local Gyms they have good stock of supplements as well. Try al Al Freej Sports in Mansoura, then there is one Gym behind old National Library they have good collections of supplements.

Hardcone., Thanks for your comment. My Profession is Engineer. It is same in my labour contract and RP and also in sponsor's letter. The issue is they are expecting a BEng degree for engineer visa.

If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q398	Q398_R87_C4

i apply family rp 22nd and got a document receipt the same day; but till today i check onlin MOI. it still show there under review. any friends here have some idea? please thanks a lot	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q398	Q398_R87_C10

And the only thing for him to know if he passed the medical exam is because he did the fingerprinting process. And is there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam?	0	Q399	Q399_R24_C4
is medical required if the visitor soon re-enter after the exit of 6 month	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	0	Q399	Q399_R24_C5

is medical required if the visitor soon re-enter after the exit of 6 month	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q399	Q399_R35_C4

is medical required if the visitor soon re-enter after the exit of 6 month	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q399	Q399_R35_C10

For some countries they allow without test but you are not from one of those countries. Also GCC valid license holders need to just exchange their license for a fee.

is medical required if the visitor soon re-enter after the exit of 6 month	Visas on arrival (100 QR) can be renewed once (for an additional 100QR) then you have to leave the country and return (Bahrain Air has fares in the range of 411 QR). I'm not sure if a tourist visa obtained through a hotel can be renewed though. You can try renewing it at the Immigration Office near the airport. If you do, great, if not, Bahrain has a great First Class lounge--far surpassing the public bus terminal called the Silver Lounge at DIA.	0	Q399	Q399_R81_C3
is medical required if the visitor soon re-enter after the exit of 6 month	"Hi! I got here a month ago and my visa( it must have been a tourist visa) should expire tomorrow. Since my husband has an RP and he lives here I gave his address until I apply for an RP under his sponsor. Since his sponsor had to leave the country on family vacation I didn't have time to process the RP. We thought we might try our luck and see if we could get my visa extended and thank God it worked. We went to the ministry of interior building which is across the street from the parking lot( all the way back) with another name on it called passport and airport security. First we went to the airport( arrival)section where they have an immigration place but I think since it was like 5.00pm it was closed. Anyway we asked at the information counter about visa extention and she directed us even from where she stood to a building behind the ""Click"" billboard across the street from the airport. So we went there. Within the vicinity there are 2 or 3 smaller buildings for specificic travel needs. Go to the visa section. The actual counters for visa was closed but apposite those counters is a travel permit counter ( no.2) you can extend your visa there provided you have a debit or visa credit card to pay QR100 for the visa. It was pretty easy. They'll put a sticker with your name and 1 month visa on it. We were so happy we wanted to tell everyone about it. Until we get the RP process underway we have some peace of mind. Thanks to all those people who have provided some information on visa extension on qatarliving. It's a great site. Anyway I am looking for DEWALT cordless drill batteries and board or wood that I can buy here in Qatar. Does anyone know where I can purchase them?"	0	Q399	Q399_R81_C4

I have Indian bike license with me. And is there any service centre for Royal Enfield here?	Yes, I think women can ride motorcycles in Qatar. Check with any driving school around Doha in order to acquire the license. And if you have a western driving license, you can go directly to the traffic police to convert it right away. It will take you 30 minutes. Prices are cheaper than in Europe and more or less like in the states. A good 600cc bike will cost you from 28000QR to 50000 depends on the make and model. Most of the bikes around for sale are either racing or off road but there are a few nice scooters and street city bikes on the market For Example: A Ducati Monster = 40000 A Triumph 675 = 35000 A Harley Davidson Sportster or Nightster = 42000 If you don't like the models available on the market, you can always go to the dealer and order the model you want, just like I did... it will take a couple of months to arrive but it might be worth it. 2nd hand bikes are quite cheap too if you want to consider this option but you need more time to bump into the bike that suits your requirements. The weather in Qatar is good for riding for 8 months per year... forget about riding in June July August and September. As for traffic, the bike is the most wonderful thing that happened to me. It saves me PLENTY of time and stress. I personally haven't had any problems from the way people drive here. As long as you have a fast and light bike and know how to ride in a city. If you need future help, don't hesitate to contact me. Good Luck.	0	Q400	Q400_R25_C6

I have Indian bike license with me. And is there any service centre for Royal Enfield here?	"If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin, you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However, if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE, THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up, you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license, however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started, you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department, where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist, for a small fee). If you have entered the country on a business visa, your sponsor will need to sign the form. The documents required for a temporary license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin. * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs (remember, if you normally wear glasses, you should be wearing them in the photo) Upon presentation of the above documents you will undergo an eye test, which is performed there and then on the premises. You will need to find (not an easy task), and then pay, the cashier. The fee is QR 150 and you will need a credit card as no cash payments are accepted. You should be able to collect the license the following day. A temporary license allows you to drive rental cars, however you may not be insured to drive a privately owned car - this is purely at the discretion of the individual insurance company and they should be contacted to ensure coverage. Upon receipt of your residence visa, you will be able to apply for a permanent license, which is valid for five years. If you are caught driving without a license, the penalty is QR 100. Holders of GCC driving licenses can obtain a permanent Qatar driving license automatically, regardless of their country of origin. The majority of European and Western licenses can also be automatically exchanged; however, due to the constantly changing regulations, it is prudent to check with the traffic department at the time of applying. If you do have an exchangeable license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department (489 0666) and complete an application form that then needs to be typed in Arabic and signed by your sponsor. The documents required for a permanent license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin * No objection letter from your sponsor (in Arabic) * Copy of trade license (if you are sponsored by a company) * Copy of your sponsor's ID * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs Upon presentation of the above documents, you will undergo an eye test, which is performed immediately on the premises. Pay the cashier a fee of QR 155 (no cash payments are accepted so take your credit card!). You should be able to collect the license the following day. If you are unfortunate enough to come from a country that is not allowed to automatically exchange licenses, you will have to undergo a driving test. This involves both an oral test and a road test. The tests are conducted in manual transmission cars and there may be up to four people in the car, each one taking turns to drive. During the holy month of Ramadan ladies are not permitted to take a road test. The operating hours for the traffic department are strictly 07:00 to 11:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, however, the ladies section is only open in the morning. At closing time, you will be asked to return either in the evening or the next day, regardless of how far you are in the queue! If you are prepared to wake up early and be there at 07:00, you will find it quite quiet.

Some people has no driving license driving around Doha and when they meet accident they run and leave their vehicles because they can be in a serious trouble in this country! or Some people are driving legally using their International Driving License but in process of the local Driving license as you cannot avoid it, you should apply for the local one too! In my case, before having the local driving license, I was depending on my Int'l Driving license, since I arrived here for at least 7 to 8 months, I had an accident and had my Resident Permit and showed it to the traffic police and voala! my car is fixed back to it's beauty!

Dear QLR; please advice me for UK visit visa bank statement required and how much balance they need at the time of visa application. thanks.	as per experience, ot takes about 3 to 5 days for them to release the visa/results. If it's your first time, you can download the form from the VSF link above, or as what we do, we download and fill up a draft copy and then fill out the actual form in the VSF office. It's a loooong form :D Better go first thing in the morning since there's less queue. Bring all requirements listed, including: letter from company stating your salary/position and tenure official bank statement (6 mos i think) your work visa passport picture marriage contract (in case ur bringing wife) and some other (just pls dbl check in the website) Always bring the original + photocopy when you get there, after filling up the forms, they will gather all your documents and put it in a sealed envelope -- everything will be couriered to UK in 24 hrs and even the result is sealed when u get it back, so the VSF people do not really have a say on the results. btw, they will also get your fingerprints and picture and signature, all digital.

Dear QLR; please advice me for UK visit visa bank statement required and how much balance they need at the time of visa application. thanks.	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ...

What's the big fuss of changing your position on your VISA? Can you even READ what is written on your PATAQA? Do you go around with, showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title, not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'.

They will hunt us down until the day we die and probably even after that. Here's a few things from the IRS site. You (and I) really need to ask a professional because it's tricky and I really don't know what to do. I have read something else before about living out of the country for all but 30 days of the year and that being one of the reasons for exemption but I can't find the exact wording... http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97324,00.html If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the United States, you generally are required to file income tax returns, estate tax returns, and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the United States. Your income, filing status, and age generally determine whether you must file a return. Generally, you must file a return if your gross income from worldwide sources is at least the amount shown for your filing status in the Filing Requirements table in Chapter 1 of Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to $82,400 of your foreign earnings. In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.	0	Q401	Q401_R64_C1

Let me know if you do talk to a professional because right now I've been operating on the ""ignorance-is-bliss"" philosophy which isn't that smart! Significant Penalty Imposed for Not Filing Expatriation Form The Internal Revenue Service reminds practitioners that anyone who has expatriated or terminated his U.S. residency status must file Form 8854, Initial and Annual Expatriation Information Statement (PDF). Form 8854 must also be filed to comply with the annual information reporting requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6039G, if the person is subject to tax under Section 877 of the Code. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed for failure to file Form 8854 when required. IRS is sending notices to expatriates that have not complied with the Form 8854 requirements, including the imposition of the $10,000 penalty where appropriate. The Instructions for Form 8854 (PDF) provide details about the filing requirements, related definitions and line-by-line instructions for completing the form.

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit!

Even if you run out your RP and will leave after 2 months from its expiration date, you still need an exit permit from your sponsor to leave the country. UNLESS... like i said, if they reported you to the authority as absconding or run away from sponsor. Then your sponsor is no longer responsible for you but the authority, and the authority will look for you and deport you without the need of exit permit.	0	Q402	Q402_R31_C8

I'm in Qatar with business visa for one month; do I need an exit permit if I want to leave before the end of the month ?	HI-Roeland... the cost for one exit is 10Qrs thats the governmet fees. And the fees for multiple exit is 500Qrs, this also from the govt. Usually one exit is more than enough for a normal employee and probably if he/she needs more travelling your sponsor can issue the exit when ever you needs it. And one important thing, if you are vanishing all of a sudden doing any illegal activities without the knowledge of the sponsor, he will be in trouble after you leave. So if you are contacting the sponsor each time for exit, he can ensure there is no complaints, bank loans, huge telephone bills, accident issues, over due in salary etc etc etc. Its highly adviceable for those who are into the field of business or frequent flyers... Its a matter of trust. And if you are flying atleast 30 times an year, you can say I need multiple exit. else its waste of money only. Hope the doubt is clear...	0	Q402	Q402_R52_C3

I'm in Qatar with business visa for one month; do I need an exit permit if I want to leave before the end of the month ?	i didn't understand, did they promiss you a work visa nd residence permit? or what's your question? Do you want to go home? or you want to stay and work here? I don't get you. But anyway, if your business visa is expiring first time (meaning you are in Qatar less than 30 days), and you have to leave the country, you don't need an exit permit. Check your ticket, may be it has return flight. Just go to the airport and leave. If not, ask your company what they are planning for you. we cannot know here what your company's arrangment is. To send you home? to extend your visa? to issue work visa and RP for you? ask your manager.	0	Q402	Q402_R78_C5

hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q403	Q403_R15_C4

hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q403	Q403_R15_C10
hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	As far as i know, that is not so difficult.  If you know any mandoub, ask him for help and explain that you want to sponsor someone not related to you. Even your travel agent can arrange for it.  Al Deera is one example.  They can book you in Al Maha Services at the airport.  They will provide everything from visa processing up to clearing at immigration here at the airport. You have to check if her nationality is among those who are being granted visa at the airport. Examples are: ·         USA ·         Greece ·         France ·         Germany ·         Sweden ·         Italy   If not, then you have to process at least 3 days prior to her departure.	0	Q403	Q403_R24_C1

hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	You can search here ... Its mentioned more than 1000 times.. We also got our application rejected and thrice we met the captain ... every month we met in the hope that it will be approved but no use... and at last one of my friend suggested to call up this guy at 66537722 to seek help, and he got it approved for us.	0	Q403	Q403_R29_C1
hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	"you could set appointment by bringing the copy of receipt and then they will put the date and time on it. in my case, the appointment was set 1 month after I requested for the meeting. so many reasons why application is rejected. if they have problem on your papers they will tell you, if that can still be supported by providing other documents, then they might put the status under ""postpone"" while waiting for your other papers. They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here. Good luck"	0	Q403	Q403_R29_C2

hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	Thanks for your positive and kind response. Few people says like, they wont approve it, no use in meeting the captain, just go through some intermediate person or call this number. Are they say this to us to go through intermediate person, so that they will get the commision like that. If it is some minimal amount means we can bare it. But when I call those numbers they are asking blindly 10000 QAR to 17000 QAR to get the Visa approved. They dont know the value of the money, simply misguiding the peoples to loose the money. Please put your valuable experience, whoever faced the issue like me.	0	Q403	Q403_R29_C4

hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ... But then again it is only my opinion.  	0	Q403	Q403_R36_C4
hi; i want to know if in my passport Qatar visa is not cancelled; can i able to travel other countries.	very well... that it is almost next to impossible to get US or Canadian tourist visa for someone who is young and not married. No matter what papers you will provide (bank statements showing that you can spend there $10,000 in 1 week or undertaking letter from your job that they guarantee your return), by the way dutchess01 no matter who is your sponsor in Qatar either...For example, if you are egyptian/lebanese/syrian (or indian/srilankian/philipino, etc...) single guy of 25-26 y.o...or so.. then FORGET ABOUT IT.. unless you are sooo much lucky… and if you DO get a visa by the chance, it's a very rare exception rather than the rule. sometimes they even reject to give a visitor's visa to the spouse of the american or canadian citizen...it's also pretty common practice... so guys relax and go to Maldives for your vacation...lol.... the only Company who can get a visa to US (the business one)relatively easy is Microsoft, as these guys are supported by Bill Gates..lol... *********************** [img_assist|nid=71431|title=This Too Shall Pass|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]	0	Q403	Q403_R36_C5

Hi; I need to know ;when the companies should do the payment for a work visa (QR 300.00).When they applying the visa or after approval of the visa?	Fact : If your company terminates you, take that letter to your bank , you won't be required to pay any remaining amount , bank will use its tacts , don't yield , after few days of delay , finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank, may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.	0	Q404	Q404_R48_C8

Bring her over under visit visa first then when your visa is ready for her to transfer just go to Immigration and they will put the visa under her name. no problem even you brought her over under visit visa it's even better than kadama visa straight away because she has to go through lots of processing in our end. this is what we normally do nowadays to avoid all the long procesing.

Regarding the starting salary,if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas, that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1,000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha, then that might need to be adjusted.

can someone tell me how an accomodation in qatar looks like? i mean do i share room with someone? thanks.	"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse, the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment, nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals, plus one for openning this year, in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor, if you will be assigned in al khor, your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home, not all patients know english.

Am a Qatari with 4 persons in my family n I sure spend more than 1000 a week on grocery, even though I am on a continues diet :P. But maybe the much spending is cause I have a wife who likes to cook for the whole neighborhood :( To answer the question of how much it cost, it depends on the person n the family. I have a friend with a wife n 4 kids who always brags about spending no more than 1000 a month on all groceries. But that's done by waking up at 5 AM n driving to the industrial area or the farms to buy the veggies n meat n the waterfront to buy fish.

Have any1 recently applied family visit visa; are they also asking electricity bill along with the house contract. Pls help. Thanks.	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q406	Q406_R22_C4

Have any1 recently applied family visit visa; are they also asking electricity bill along with the house contract. Pls help. Thanks.	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q406	Q406_R22_C10

Hopefully they will get it right and make proper habitats for the animals instead of the awfully small cages they had before. Hope they also raise awareness toward animal treatment--- ie. ban the practice of letting children harass, improperly feed, and hit the animals.	0	Q407	Q407_R3_C9

Any idea about a zoo near Al Zuvair; Jumila (spelling not correct)Near Dukhan;	Mowasalat changes bus route timingsPublished: Monday, 21 August, 2006, 11:42 AM Doha Time Mowasalat officials announcing the changes to the bus timings and the introduction of the new services at a press briefing at the company headquarters. Staff Reporter MOWASALAT, the public transport company, has changed the timings of its bus services with effect from August 27 and added a few more routes to its network while increasing the frequency of some of the routes. After the changes come into force, most of Doha and Al Rayyan areas will be within 1km of a Karwa bus service, Mowasalat officials told a press conference yesterday. New direct links have been created particularly to the Industrial Area, where the number of services increases from just one at present to five. All services will have new timetables from next Sunday, Mowasalat mass transit director Anthony Tallant said. Generally, each service will operate at least every 30 minutes, and the timetables are planned so that where services run along the same route, a bus is scheduled every 10 or 15 minutes. The new schedule is as follows: Service 10: Bus Station - Al Hilal, no change. Service 11: Bus Station - Al Matar Al Qadeem, no change. Service 12: Bus Station - Abu Hamour (and Medical Commission), no change. Service 22, Bus Station - Abu Hamour , no change. Service 32: Bus Station - Industrial Area (south west). This service will follow its existing route as far as Al Sadd Stadium, and then continue via Al Waab Street (stopping at Khalifa Stadium, Villagio and Hyatt Plaza), Al Forousiya Street (for Doha Zoo), Fort Roundabout, Al Karajat Street (northern section) and Al Attiyah Souq. Its terminus will be at the extreme west-end of Street 38. The poorly used section between Al Sadd Stadium and Doha College will no longer be served. Service 33: Bus Station - Industrial Area (south). The terminus points of service 33 do not change. However, its route in the northern Industrial Area is changed to operate from Street 2 to Street 15 via Al Binaar Street (instead of Al Manajer Street) . The basic frequency of Service 33 is reduced from every 10 minutes to every 30 minutes, but there are two new services covering a major part of this route. Service 33A: Bus Station - Industrial Area (south east). This is a new service between Al Ghanim Bus Station and the eastern side of the Industrial Area. Service 33A is the same as service 33 as far as Street 2, then it operates via Al Karajat Street (northern section), Al Attiyah Souq, returning to Al Karajat Street (Street 23). Using East Industrial Street to access the southern area, it once again joins Al Karajat Street, to terminate at the east-end of Street 47. The basic frequency of Service 33A will be every 30 minutes. Service 33B: Bus Station - Industrial Area (north west). This is another new service between Al Ghanim Bus Station and the north western section of the Industrial Area. Service 33B is the same as service 33 as far as Fort Roundabout, then continues along Salwa Road. Entering the Industrial Area at West Industrial Street, it operates via Al Imran Street and Al Attiyah Souq before serving Street 24 and terminating on Street 26. The frequency of this service will be also 30 minutes. The timetables of services 32, 33, 33A and 33B are designed to provide a bus at least every 8 minutes at Al Attiyah Souq, and every 10 minutes along Salwa Road, Mowasalat officials said.

Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much.

If you get all teh documents from your sponsor yourself and submit them personally at Visa office in Madina Khalifa, it normally takes 3-5 days. However, if you are working in a Q company like QP, QAFCO, QAPCO etc. you must give about 3-4 weeks for the process to complete since the HR people in these companies are lazy, lethargic and downright incompetent.	0	Q408	Q408_R33_C8

When you send your old passport to get renewed, they will attach both of them the new and the old. When you get them back just go to the immigration and they will cancel both, the old passport and old visa and issue you a new visa with the same details of the old one. Don't worry about it, should take nothing more than 5 minutes to print the new visa and stick it on the new passport.

Below is a guide in obtaining Police (NBI) clearance: o Go the Philippine Embassy (phone: 483-1585) o Fingerprinting process is only from 1pm – 3pm (it will take you 45mins maximum) and bring with you the following:  2 x 2 photograph with white background (taken not more than 3 months)  Copy of Passport  QAR 100.00 fee o The embassy representative will hand over the accomplished fingerprint form (stamped, signed and photo attached) o Send the following documents to the Philippines along with the following:  Personal copy of old NBI clearance (if you still have it for faster processing)  Clear copy of passport copy  Signed authorization letter for your representative (relative, friend, agency)  In addition, you can send copy of valid IDs with your signature just to be on the safe side  Applicable fees (info to follow) o Sending of documents through Q-post office would cost: QAR 55.00 for EMS (door to door delivery in 4 days) QAR 9.00 for registered mail (2 weeks) o Requirements need to go to the main NBI office in Caloocan, Metro Manila for obtaining NBI clearance (I do not have the info for other regions Php115) o After obtaining the Renewed NBI Clearance, proceed to the Department of Foreign Affairs to authenticate the document (processing fee Php100-200) o Bring the documents back to the Philippine embassy in Qatar for stamping and authentication and QAR100.00 fee o Go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs close to the corniche for attestation (QAR20 they only accept debit/credit cards) Hope this helps!	0	Q408	Q408_R62_C5

As far as I know and from my experience in our company, a husband cannot get his wife a residency unless after 6 months of stay in Doha, since one of the required documents fo the Immigration is a 6-month bank statement in order to get a Family Residence, or 3-month statement for a Family Visit Visa (valid for 6 months only).

Dear Maji08, They did not ask you because being a resident of Qatar, you must have already done your finger print for your RP, which is saved in their comuter records.

Could you please anybody help me. I have a valid Qatari Driving License; cancelled my RP earlier and now came back on business visa; did i have to take temporary license ??	"If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin, you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However, if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE, THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up, you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license, however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started, you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department, where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist, for a small fee). If you have entered the country on a business visa, your sponsor will need to sign the form. The documents required for a temporary license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin. * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs (remember, if you normally wear glasses, you should be wearing them in the photo) Upon presentation of the above documents you will undergo an eye test, which is performed there and then on the premises. You will need to find (not an easy task), and then pay, the cashier. The fee is QR 150 and you will need a credit card as no cash payments are accepted. You should be able to collect the license the following day. A temporary license allows you to drive rental cars, however you may not be insured to drive a privately owned car - this is purely at the discretion of the individual insurance company and they should be contacted to ensure coverage. Upon receipt of your residence visa, you will be able to apply for a permanent license, which is valid for five years. If you are caught driving without a license, the penalty is QR 100. Holders of GCC driving licenses can obtain a permanent Qatar driving license automatically, regardless of their country of origin. The majority of European and Western licenses can also be automatically exchanged; however, due to the constantly changing regulations, it is prudent to check with the traffic department at the time of applying. If you do have an exchangeable license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department (489 0666) and complete an application form that then needs to be typed in Arabic and signed by your sponsor. The documents required for a permanent license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin * No objection letter from your sponsor (in Arabic) * Copy of trade license (if you are sponsored by a company) * Copy of your sponsor's ID * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs Upon presentation of the above documents, you will undergo an eye test, which is performed immediately on the premises. Pay the cashier a fee of QR 155 (no cash payments are accepted so take your credit card!). You should be able to collect the license the following day. If you are unfortunate enough to come from a country that is not allowed to automatically exchange licenses, you will have to undergo a driving test. This involves both an oral test and a road test. The tests are conducted in manual transmission cars and there may be up to four people in the car, each one taking turns to drive. During the holy month of Ramadan ladies are not permitted to take a road test. The operating hours for the traffic department are strictly 07:00 to 11:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, however, the ladies section is only open in the morning. At closing time, you will be asked to return either in the evening or the next day, regardless of how far you are in the queue! If you are prepared to wake up early and be there at 07:00, you will find it quite quiet.

After 7 days, but only up to obtaining your Residency Permit, you can drive using a Qatari temporary license or an International driving license. After getting your RP, you will need to convert it to Qatari permanent driving license either by direct conversion (from some countries) or sitting through the test.

As some of you have suggested, to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States, not Canada.  Also, the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa, you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age, education level, profession, employment status, english proficiency, suitability, and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!	0	Q409	Q409_R85_C8

If you go and make complain and if you are not claiming full insurance then you will get the papers immediately. The police will just look at the damage make a report and ask you to put a QR5/- stamp. Thats all you just take the paper and go to any garage of your choice. Other wise you may have to wait for a few days sometimes as less as 3 and after that they will give you the report. I think if you are going to claim insurance then you need to pay QR 100/- at the traffic dept I think before they give you the paper to take to the insurance company.	0	Q410	Q410_R28_C3

I had to do this one time.   I simply called the bank and they took the necessary info over the phone and handled it.  Of course here in Qatar it will probably not be as easy.   Go to the bank and talk to the customer service people.	0	Q410	Q410_R111_C2
Wich document should i need submit the srilankan embessy in qatar for get the police report? and how much charge ? Advice please.	Thanks.  Actually, i just want to know if they do it differently in other banks like CBQ, QNB, Doha Bank, Standard Chartered, etc. I have my account with HSBC. I just have a problem with my landlord, as they already asked us to vacate the house. Now, i still have a cheque as a deposit and he still hasn't returned it to me.  So i went to the bank and asked them to cancel the payment for that cheque. Guess what, they said they can't do that unless i go to the police first and get a report.  Weird for something like this.  That is my account and i should have the prerogative to cancel the payment.  It is my problem if somebody tries to cash the cheque and finds out it has been cancelled, right?	0	Q410	Q410_R111_C3

Wich document should i need submit the srilankan embessy in qatar for get the police report? and how much charge ? Advice please.	What the police report is for is should your landlord present the cheque (out of malice) is negaite you from the responsiblity. If you stop the cheque without the police report or by not having the money in the account then you are the person responsible and it means that you can be arrested and detained by the police till you make the payment. so your land lord wins if you go to the police present your case and get the report to present to the bank then should your landlord present the cheque then you have done nothing wrong and he cannot claim the money and wont be able to claim the money and you won't end up in jail.	0	Q410	Q410_R111_C7

They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected.

I want to issue a visit visa for my parents but I heard there is an age limit &#38; the visa may get rejected due to that! please advise	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ...

"for your info: ""The Cambridge Diet is a controversialvery low calorie diet involving severe calorie restriction combined with nutritional supplementation. It was developed in 1970 by Dr. Alan Howard at Cambridge University, United Kingdom as a method of rapidly shedding weight while reducing loss of lean body weight. The core principle of the diet is severe calorie restriction, as low as 400 calories/day, combined with supplements of minerals, vitamins and fatty acids to reduce the loss of nutrients typical of severe calorie restriction. However, experts note that some essential nutrients may still be lost, leading to potential problems such as heart arrythmias and other side effects. As a result, it is claimed that the diet in its original form has contributed to a number of deaths."" read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_Diet"	0	Q413	Q413_R64_C8

Hi; Can any 1 guide the procedure for circumcision in qatar for babies and the cost associates with it. P.s-- baby born in home country and in permanent visa in qatar	"According to the little information I know, circumcised means less friction. Guess thats why they are relating it to cutting down down. I am coming from a country with various religions. For Muslims, as well as the Jews, it is compulsory and usually it is done within a month from birth. But I remember that some Christian guys were circumcised when they are old for hygienic reasons. I don't know what is involved in ""hygienic"" and never asked. Ladies please do not read the following story. A Christian friend of mine told me an incident that happened to his relative (a male) and they made fun out of it. Usually, our culture is that the girl should be virgin. SO that guy on his wedding night and while doing his ""duties"" had that ""annex"" removed due to the incident and wrong meneuvers and started bleeding. His relatives and friends started saying that instead of the bride loosing her virginity, it ended up that the groom lost his virginity. Now you can read the remaining part ladies.

Hi; Can any 1 guide the procedure for circumcision in qatar for babies and the cost associates with it. P.s-- baby born in home country and in permanent visa in qatar	circumcision is a must!, I can't believe other people and in most places do not do this practice. well... Research studies indicate that there are good medical reasons why your son should be circumcised. These include: * Circumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first year of his life. Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high (around xxx %), UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat (see here for a discussion). * Cancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males. * Research shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections (e.g. yeast infections). * Circumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood. * Circumcision prevents phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age. * Genital hygiene is easier after circumcision. * Circumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma.	0	Q414	Q414_R25_C6

P.s-- baby born in home country and in permanent visa in qatar	Forgive me for being so dumb but I don't get the story about the Christian guy. Do you mean he knocked on the wrong foor and suffered some injury? I don't know much about circumsion. For those of us born in the United States in the 1960s it was normal procedure for all male babies and was done within days of birth. I was one of those babies and it never occurred to me to ask why it was done. In my case, not for religious reasons as I am not Muslim or Jewish. Since I have always been circumcised I don't know what the alternative is like. Maybe the ladies have a view on this. Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.

Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

I and my family have recently moved to Qatar..could anyone recommend a good paediatrician please.	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	0	Q415	Q415_R45_C5

Regarding the starting salary,if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas, that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1,000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha, then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals.

"Dr S, I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital, and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon, therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway, there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program, you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board, HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam, the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8,200/month (excluding Housing). 4.

Does MANDOOB visa can get family visa?	What's the big fuss of changing your position on your VISA? Can you even READ what is written on your PATAQA? Do you go around with, showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title, not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree, but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare, it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0	Q417	Q417_R8_C9

Does MANDOOB visa can get family visa?	What I understand, your husband should go by Himself and speak to the higher authority. Mandoop can guide your husband specially if your husband cant speak arabic. But still people in immigrations are all professional. They need some explaination more from your husband rather than from your mandoop. This does not mean you can get it if you go there. Sometimes you have to come not only once, twice but sometimes more than 3 times. So let your husband prepare all the papers and go by himself. Speak to higher authority and get the document signed.

Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

Does MANDOOB visa can get family visa?	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much.

And it is too risky to exit to other Asian country and exit from there coming to Qatar, the immigration in other Asian countries are already informed about these back door exits, hence departure from there coming to other countries might be disallowed. If you're interested, send me message and I can give you the no. of an agent who is processing for deployment, meaning work visa will be processed thru POEA legally. He processed for my sister's work visa. Anyhow, you can try other means if you want to take the risk.	0	Q418	Q418_R32_C5

Hi, Being a direct hire from the Philippines entails a lot of head ache considering the red tape in Manila if could be very frustrating until the very end. With so many requirements to prepare and a lot more, chances are you will not be able to come to Qatar in just 30 days (if you are lucky enough). I am a Recruitment Officer in Doha and I bring people from Manila via the Bangkok route, meaning you book yourself as tourist to Bangkok (round trip ticket, a night stay in a hotel) and the following day you can board a plane to Doha. Honestly, we get nothing from the government not even a good service. SMS me and I will tell you this way, when you arrive in Doha, just register at the Polo Office.	0	Q418	Q418_R32_C6
Is there any age limit for business visa? i want to bring my son in business visa he is 17 years old only.	Kabayan, there are no more direct hire employees coming from the Philippines. There should be a job order filed by the employer through the Embassy here. This job order is to be given to an accredited recruitment agency. This is to assure and guarantee the safety of the employee to be hired. In short, there will be placement fees, pre-employment medical, PDOS, visa processing, etc. Cumbersome, time consuming but safe.

Is there any age limit for business visa? i want to bring my son in business visa he is 17 years old only.	this is a real problem, i believe. as far as I know, no accrediated university/college offers provides a 100% distant learning bachelors degree programme. They'd require you to study FULL-TIME or Atleast spend 2 years at the college/university. However you could get executive certificate, diploma programs etc. http://www.u21global.edu.sg/Education/About/Offices#ua but that'd be overly expensive, and might not be as useful for you, as for any graduate person. If you can afford to stay away from work for 2 years atleast go back to your home country to get a bachelors, or try QU/CNAQ Qatar or Dubai universities if you can afford.

Anyway, there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program, you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board, HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam, the passing mark was 55. 3.

Is there any age limit for business visa? i want to bring my son in business visa he is 17 years old only.	I wish my mom or mother in law were here, or maybe someone other from my family. Sadly I dont. I dont have anyone here. I do everything for my son, breakfast, lunch, and even wash him before I leave home. She feed him the breakfast and lunch, and changed him probably 2 times while I am away. He sleeps out of 6 hours at home 2-3 hours, so literally she stays with him awake around 3-4 hours which are great. He always sounds happy when I call to check on him. My husband also bombards her with calls asking her about our son. Our son makes noises and sings when I talk toher on the phone and even when I get home he is singing. I know them he is ok and happy. I am the one who baths him and take care of HIM when I reach home. The maid doesnt touch or seem him again until the next morning!!!	0	Q418	Q418_R65_C8

what is the best and Safe online account to Receive Money ?????? Please advise....	i use alsayrafa exchange at the souq. charge is only QAR 12 bank to bank. it usually takes 3 days for major banks. they have western union services too but i'm a cheapo. when my dad was still here, he sent money one time and my mom (quite irresponsibly) didn't inform us that she changed her bank account number. my mom is also not in the habit of checking her account balance so she usually cannot answer us if the remittance has been credited or not before she changed her account. alsayrafa was considerate enough to contact my dad and said the remittance won't go through. we wouldn't have known what happened to the money if they didn't call my dad. alfardan is okay too and i used to send from there, but i had a friend who had some sort of discrepancy with his bank account name and the bank in the phils won't accept the remittance. after a few days of wondering why the money hasn't been credited, he wouldn't have known the reason if he didn't check and ask them. it's probably not a big deal and ultimately it is our responsibility to confirm these things but still...i'm not sure if alfardan would've contacted my friend eventually though, or if other exchanges do these things as well.	0	Q419	Q419_R5_C6

Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer, Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank, so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account & This transfer is also fast, most of the time one working day.	0	Q419	Q419_R13_C4

If you are so willing to pay the debts, why didn't you just go to the bank and do it before you left?  It doesn't take that long to visit a bank and pay a bill - 3 hours tops.  I would say you are now black listed with the CID and you won't get a visa to return.  If you come you may get arrested at immigration.	0	Q419	Q419_R49_C2

what is the best and Safe online account to Receive Money ?????? Please advise....	It is very serious to leave the country and not pay debts, banks in general don't like this even if there is an insurance to cover bad debts. If we have debts, we are responsible to act accordingly to pay the debts, otherwise anyone can come to Qatar, borrow money, and then disappear - hmmm I don't think so -  this is a capital offence. His best bet is to check with the bank to see if they have done anything i.e. informed the police or CID otherwise there is a high risk that he will be arrested upon arrival at Doha.	0	Q419	Q419_R49_C9
what is the best and Safe online account to Receive Money ?????? Please advise....	If the bank has already informed the authorities and you are on the black list, it is a problem... unless you sort out with the bank and they clear your name . Clearing the name again can be a problem since the offence is a state offence and not a matter of the bank only.. If they have not informed the bank... talking and sorting things out may help.... All depends on the amount... Normally bank may not care about small amounts, unless big enough to cover the cost of following it up...

Qatar University? well probably you'll be put in a nice big compound near Villaggio with good facilities for a start. they give good benefits if you're single you will have a 3 bedroom flat if you're married you will have a 4 bedroom villa including your own office at home that makes you work diligently plus on top of that they will give you, your wife and children a return ticket every year and give you generous interest free car loan as you arrive, they give your children school allowance up to 80,000 plus family medicals on top of it. Only thing! Please take it as an advice, never join the committee at the compound as they only want you to demand more to the employer which is a bad habit and ungreatful attitude. never get involve in any of this committee as the employer don't like them. stay away from these people to keep you safe and don't get involve with any of their activities. live normal and peacefully.

what is the best and Safe online account to Receive Money ?????? Please advise....	JJH gave a pretty good account of the living area. Al Zahoor-2 is near 2 large shopping centres and many of the larger international schools (American School or Doha College). The only thing I would say is the villa/apartments are dealt out by degrees and departments. Masters get apartments/PhD’s get villas. Of course there are some exceptions but I'm married with a child as are 4 of my neighbors and we all live in an apartment. I would say if you are working for Foundation and have a Masters you can expect an apartment, which are pretty nice and big. Once you get them cleaned and your own personal touches on them they are very livable. There is a swimming pool in the complex and a fitness room. The fitness room is useable but many people join outside gyms like Aspire (10 minutes away). As for not joining a committee, I would disagree with JJH about the reason. Many people have tried to make the place look nicer and stay cleaner (more greenery, outdoor lighting, cleaning, etc...)because it needs it. This in itself is very frustrating. It was made very clear that the complex is what it is and changes or more investment by the owner will not happen. For this reason joining this committee can be very embittering and this could blanket your whole experience with the place. Plus, your students and portfolio will bring you enough blood rising. This may be a better reason to avoid these committees. But, if you are a champion for a cause, you can get in the mix. Fighting city hall or join the new Al-Zahoor Sheriff flyer ticketing group. Clamp down on double parkers!! OK, good luck with the move. I imagine you arrive Aug 24th or so, get ready to be on a bus going from one place to another for the whole week. You will particularly enjoy the medical commission. Don't worry you are not joining the Army. And, because you work for QU, you'll get VIP service. This means no waiting outside in sun like the construction workers. Wahoo!! Good times! Cheers, DMM	0	Q419	Q419_R54_C8

We have a bad experience every time we join any committee in any compound we used to lived in, we just get into further trouble. This committee is design to go against the management (more rather trouble makers) which we don’t really need to be involved with. We are peaceful and grateful family so if they have problem to the management let them sort it out on their own they should leave us alone and no need to bother other people who are not a member because we are not likely to support them. The management or employer can get rid of you! if you go against them and we are here for job not to get involved in any troubles. Thank you! and for the credit with Qatar University? Yes! they are definitely GENEROUS no doubt about it. If people has demands? they should deal with them in their own way, like what we do it in our own way, and we don't need to be ganging on our employer, it's just not going to help you, They prepare if you go straight to them on your own rather than by group. satisfaction is a secret in order to make yourself happy! :P"	0	Q419	Q419_R54_C10

His price was very reasonable, a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall, and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred, but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully, and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him, but as with any move, supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better, by yourself.

what is the best and Safe online account to Receive Money ?????? Please advise....	This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses, even the ones in which small kids travel, and even after complaining to the school many times, there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues related to school transport etc. Its time parents come together and initiate some action.	0	Q419	Q419_R74_C9

(don't forget to sign) 1) NOC from Company. 2) Contract Copy. 3) Own Passport copy, Wife's passport copy and child passport copy. 4) Attested Marriage certificate copy. 5) Attested Child's Birth Certificate copy. That's all... N.B: Separate application and the above set of documents for individuals.	0	Q420	Q420_R7_C10

Is there any salary limit for bringing spouse on visit visa?	Yes, if they are flying in from the Philippines, the copy of the approved Business Visa will need to be sent to the Philippines where they can finalize the process to exit their country. Processing a Business Visa application in Qatar can take 1 day to 2 weeks, or more... Once a Business Visa is approved, the individual has 3 months to arrive to Qatar before the validity expires. If they do not arrive within 3 months, the entire process must be restarted. Once the individual arrived in Qatar, they can stay for an initial 30 days, extendable twice, for a total of 90 days before they will be required to exit Qatar. Hope this helps!	0	Q420	Q420_R25_C4

Is there any salary limit for bringing spouse on visit visa?	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ...

No matter what papers you will provide (bank statements showing that you can spend there $10,000 in 1 week or undertaking letter from your job that they guarantee your return), by the way dutchess01 no matter who is your sponsor in Qatar either...For example, if you are egyptian/lebanese/syrian (or indian/srilankian/philipino, etc...) single guy of 25-26 y.o...or so.. then FORGET ABOUT IT.. unless you are sooo much lucky… and if you DO get a visa by the chance, it's a very rare exception rather than the rule. sometimes they even reject to give a visitor's visa to the spouse of the american or canadian citizen...it's also pretty common practice... so guys relax and go to Maldives for your vacation...lol.... the only Company who can get a visa to US (the business one)relatively easy is Microsoft, as these guys are supported by Bill Gates..lol... *********************** [img_assist|nid=71431|title=This Too Shall Pass|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]	0	Q420	Q420_R45_C5

how to calculate salary if you return from annual leave and start work on 25 October how many days you should take 6 or 7 days.	every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period, the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps	0	Q421	Q421_R15_C4

Very Frankly saying, Don't think about legal action. it will never work. gratuity per year is of 21 days. So if you didn't took it previously, you will get all your dues.

how to calculate salary if you return from annual leave and start work on 25 October how many days you should take 6 or 7 days.	Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01, 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so, the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22,093.15 Apart from this, your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that, 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.	0	Q421	Q421_R15_C9

The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND< ABSOLUTE CRAP > With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic, cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice, Schooling is covered for your children, yearly air tickets for you and family, MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family, and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included... QR 15000K is a Bare minimum, by the way having said this, whats the position...but irrespective of that, QR 8000 is just a total waste, and DO NOT ACCEPT IT! I'm not being racist here, but for other Nationalities they pay much higher and I think based on your experience you need to be paid and not based on where you come from, so chuck the 8000 QR and tell them to stuff right their *** !!!

HI In my visa it say Professional. What does this means? In this category can I sponsor my family? Please advice Thank You	Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to, in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.	0	Q422	Q422_R110_C9

Once you leave your job in Qatar how long is the ban on being able to get a work visa for a competitor? Is it one or 2 yrs?	Hi Tinkerbell10, Your comment seems to originate from utter frustration. As you might have observed, in many aspects Qatar takes Dubai as a role model where such exit permit, 2 year ban etc does not exist and therefore the world love that place. Qatar, while trying to attract international attraction eventually has to remove such bondage rules. For example, the employees can keep their pass ports but they cannot exit the country without the consent of their employer sounds like an irony. If people come to work in Qatar on a 2 year contract, they should be given choice to renew or switch to another job after successfully completing the contract. I hope the perception of Qatar Govt will change eventually to catch the international attention..as a moderately free place.	0	Q423	Q423_R4_C5

Hi Tinkerbell10, Slavery in one form or the other existed in several parts of the world from time immorial. But those days ideas of globalization, equality, freedom of speech, right to information and service were also not there. I fully agree with what you have mentioned of the malls ans labour camps. But someone has to voice such plights to the public in some reasonable way.

Qatar will change and for the better, remember how far Qatar has come in just 15 years.

Once you leave your job in Qatar how long is the ban on being able to get a work visa for a competitor? Is it one or 2 yrs?	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However, the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4, any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However, this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior, or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor, according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Once you leave your job in Qatar how long is the ban on being able to get a work visa for a competitor? Is it one or 2 yrs?	When your sponsors were told that you were not coming back from holiday, they would have proceeded quickly with cancelling your visa as they needed your visa free to allocate to somebody else. Companies have a certain number of visas allocated of certain nationalities and to replace a worker they have to cancel his visa, apply the ban and then reissue the visa to (in this case) your replacement.

hi all Some rumors are spread about family visit visa fee increased 200 to 500 or 1000. If any one known regarding subject please advise	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q424	Q424_R4_C4

hi all Some rumors are spread about family visit visa fee increased 200 to 500 or 1000. If any one known regarding subject please advise	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q424	Q424_R4_C10

hi all Some rumors are spread about family visit visa fee increased 200 to 500 or 1000. If any one known regarding subject please advise	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

However, the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4, any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However, this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior, or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor, according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

My husband (my sponsor) went to the Immigration in Al Gharraga and was told to provide NOC from the previous nationality. They said no need the NOC from the embassy of the new passport. So I went to my former embassy and got the NOC. As far as I know, you will be needing the NOC together with the filled-up form (change of nationality) and copies of the old and new passports. We submitted all the paper works last week and told to come back in 2 weeks. You will be given a receipt that they have received the documents. By the way, the form must be filled-up and signed by your sponsor. Regards	0	Q425	Q425_R32_C8

As far as I know, yor wife needs a RP (residence Permit) which can only be done once you have yours. If she come on the Visit visa, she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights (Hospital, Bank account finding a job etc). Not to say that she can not come on the Visit Visa but she would have to leave after the Visa expired and apply for a Residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in Qatar.	0	Q425	Q425_R48_C1

Once you get your RP, you can transfer her sponsorship under you, coz the company will give her No Objection Cert., She doesn't need to exit and go back to her country. Once you applied for her the business visa, you just need to obtain a supporting affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expenses during the period.

Can any confirm do we need visa for New born baby for entrance in Qatar. Baby age 2 Months	I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here, so it is not a problem. However, I think you need proof of vaccination in small kids before you entry the country. I may be wrong.

Can any confirm do we need visa for New born baby for entrance in Qatar. Baby age 2 Months	If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here, now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But, if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example, in the US they don't do BCGs, but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer, but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!	0	Q426	Q426_R57_C2

Can any confirm do we need visa for New born baby for entrance in Qatar. Baby age 2 Months	"I went to 3 places... Hamad, Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while, and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance, I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week, so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first, so bring the baby's RP, birth certificate, etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance, I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid, he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area, my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when we went there for vaccines. But the private hospitals are expensive if you don't have insurance to cover the vaccines. No need to worry, you have lots of choices here. Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 different opinions about the doctors and hospitals. Just look around for one you are comfortable with, and needing to do the vaccines is a good excuse to check out Doctors for the time when you need one for your sick baby."	0	Q426	Q426_R57_C7

I dont know if it is srilankan govt policy or not, but if I have already got the approval from the embassy, I'm assuming it is insurance to protect her in case she gets into any trouble abroad.

Can any confirm do we need visa for New born baby for entrance in Qatar. Baby age 2 Months	I will explain the insurence produre 1st. There is a government regulation that all workers irrespective of their job catogory have to pay a fee to the government something like RS. 11,000 for 2 years which includes insurence cover for any eventuallity (House maids fee should be cheeper. you can chek that with sri lankan embassy here. if you have a problem getting info from the embassy PM me. Charge de Affairs is a personal friend of mine). Nodody will be allowed leave Sri Lanka without the paid stamp in their passport. They will be stopped at the airport by the officials if they don't have that stamp. This amount shall be paid by the employee in most cases but it is up to you to negotiate that with your maid. Why don't you send her a a contract letter and the visa document, so she's on the safe side. So do you. She needs to sign one copy and send it back to you. yes you need to send the original of the contract attested by sri lanka embassy in qatar for her to obtain this stamp from the immigration department back in sri lanka. no stamp from the qatar embassy here on the contract means she will not be able to secure the immigration stamp in Sri Lanka.

Can any confirm do we need visa for New born baby for entrance in Qatar. Baby age 2 Months	It really is a personal decision and there are no wrongs or rights here.I can only speak of my experience and let you decide from there. We have 2 children one in pre4 at school and the other 3 still at home. We have a nanny who takes care of the 3 year old. We went through the newspaper and interviewed about 20 and had about 40 call. Out of 20 there were about 3 we would have gone with. We decided on one and it was O.K. but after about 2 or 3 weeks we let her go. Were going to do add again but through contacts in the building and info from our pervious add campaign we found another nanny. It has been about 6 months now and all is good. We need to revisit expectations once in a while but overall we are pleased. We have play dates arranged each week for the nanny to take our child and we have other expectations that we hope insure a nuturing and healthy day. There is good and bad to both senerios. My wife stayed home for a year when our son was 1.5 because we didn't like the kindergarden and the colds he got from parents who sent there child to school obviously ill. But rather than moan about it we just tightened the wallet and buckled down for a year. So I know both senerios, depends on you. I'd suggest here in this country you should do a lot of screening but get a nanny. Salary ranges from 1200Q to 2000Q a month for live out and working 5 or 6 days a week. Depends on your accomadations if she will live with you. If she lives with you, it would be cheaper.

I'm not familiar with special needs health facilities here in Doha so cannot give you a personal opinion, but the Marhaba magazine talks about to centres, so it might be a good starting point for you to enquiry about speech teraphy and assessment: Shafallah Centre: The opening of the centre's new state of the art facility in West Bay in 206 offers worldclass facilities and education for special needs children in Qatar.

I would like to take this opportunity and talk about bare facts regarding Autism care in Doha. My son is 7 years old and is undergoing OT in India. He is diagonsed with HFATS - high functioning autistic traights spectrum. he is joining me by last week October'07. There are just 4 neurologists in this country. I will write their names tomorrow as I do not have them handy rigth now. there is one Neurosurgeon in Doha clinic - he is more of a doctor for orthopaedic patients. Second is a lady neuro paedratic. She is in UK for her knee transplant an should be back in Doha in first week Nov'07. I did meet both of them and their feed back is neuro care is absolutely zero in Doha. There are two more neurologists in Hamad hospital. Havent met them yet. Shafallah center is for complete mentally challenged kids. I met the officials there and they would not do any OT training to outside kids. The kid has to study there and that is where our kids are different from the kids there in Shafallah. There is a lady ortho paedic doctor in Rumailah hospital, she would / could be a guide for our kid's problem.	0	Q427	Q427_R35_C7

I see a wounded stray cat near my place is there any veterinary hospital for a reasonable cost where i can take her for treatment.	The choices for support of special needs are limited here, folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed, qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but, again, populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it). I recently found an Occupational Therapist here, but it was HARD. There is a local group of expat specialists (mostly therapists, psychologists, etc.) that meet, and they do have links/references to other people here for those needing referrals, but families moving here from the States/UK/elsewhere need to know that if your child needs a lot of specialized support, then you're better off staying home. If anyone wants/needs more info, please email me for specifics. Cheers --	0	Q427	Q427_R35_C9

I see a wounded stray cat near my place is there any veterinary hospital for a reasonable cost where i can take her for treatment.	please take a read through this site http://www.messybeast.com/handrear.htm I have gone through it and it gives you the info you need to hand rear this kitten. However, I must warn you, that handrearing such tiny kitten can be harrowing and success is only 20 - 40%. Meaning, no matter how well you take care of it, death is always a nearby factor. Please don't let it upset you or feel like you've done something wrong if this happens. Kittens, unlike puppies are way more sensitive and require mom's care and attention more than puppies do. Also, there is a reason that the mom left this kitten behind - she probably felt it wasn't going to survive - survival of the fittest and all that.... 1) Don't feed cows milk - You will find Baby Kat milk at the vets - they will also have kit for you to feed the kitten with. 2) Do keep the kitten as warm as possible - they cannot regulate their own body temperature - so finding a hot water bottle( a difficult task in Doha, I have tried) or a heating pad will work as an external source of heat - never putting the kitten directly on these items as they can scold, or electricute in the case of the heating pad. 3) Do make sure to keep the kittens bowels stimulated with warm damp cotton wool - this is done after the 6 feeds at 3 hourly intervals. You rub the cotton wool over the kitten's private areas in the same manner the mom would lick the kitten to do the same. Please do read the site info I have given you, and try to find anything else useful on the internet pertaining to hand rearing kittens.	0	Q427	Q427_R43_C6
I see a wounded stray cat near my place is there any veterinary hospital for a reasonable cost where i can take her for treatment.	I cannot tell you how important it is to keep the kitten warm - use a small box, or one that will fit the hot water bottle or the heating pad, alone with a towel to cover those items - you can use a themometer and adjust the heat as described in the article I have given you. Do put a fluffy toy in with the kitten... it won't feel so alone. Don't get a fright to, if the kitten starts to deficate on its own inside its bed, this will happen too, but don't forget to stimulate it too. A kitten should urinate often, but in my experience, they only deficate 1 time a day, 2 times at the most in the first 1/2 weeks... there after it becomes more frequent.	0	Q427	Q427_R43_C7

Hello ; Am planning to apply Family Visit visa; Is Labour contract stamped by Ministry of Labour is required for applying family visit visa?	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q428	Q428_R4_C4

Hello ; Am planning to apply Family Visit visa; Is Labour contract stamped by Ministry of Labour is required for applying family visit visa?	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q428	Q428_R4_C10

"The only way for you to transfer them to family visit is by exiting the country, and coming back using the Family Visit Visa. there is no such transfer, but you can transfer it into ""husband or Father"" sponsorship. Visit visa, they need to exit, have their existing visit visa be cancelled, and enter with the new one. this way, they have maximum stay of 6 months.

Hello ; Am planning to apply Family Visit visa; Is Labour contract stamped by Ministry of Labour is required for applying family visit visa?	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

My family want to exit 20 days after expiry of her RP. How much penalty shall apply while exit from Qatar	1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks, this will create a problem for your sponsor. In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank, they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems, it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP, otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance, creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.	0	Q429	Q429_R16_C3

I'm not sure if a tourist visa obtained through a hotel can be renewed though. You can try renewing it at the Immigration Office near the airport.

My family want to exit 20 days after expiry of her RP. How much penalty shall apply while exit from Qatar	"Hi! I got here a month ago and my visa( it must have been a tourist visa) should expire tomorrow. Since my husband has an RP and he lives here I gave his address until I apply for an RP under his sponsor. Since his sponsor had to leave the country on family vacation I didn't have time to process the RP. We thought we might try our luck and see if we could get my visa extended and thank God it worked. We went to the ministry of interior building which is across the street from the parking lot( all the way back) with another name on it called passport and airport security. First we went to the airport( arrival)section where they have an immigration place but I think since it was like 5.00pm it was closed. Anyway we asked at the information counter about visa extention and she directed us even from where she stood to a building behind the ""Click"" billboard across the street from the airport. So we went there. Within the vicinity there are 2 or 3 smaller buildings for specificic travel needs. Go to the visa section. The actual counters for visa was closed but apposite those counters is a travel permit counter ( no.2) you can extend your visa there provided you have a debit or visa credit card to pay QR100 for the visa. It was pretty easy. They'll put a sticker with your name and 1 month visa on it. We were so happy we wanted to tell everyone about it. Until we get the RP process underway we have some peace of mind. Thanks to all those people who have provided some information on visa extension on qatarliving. It's a great site.

My family want to exit 20 days after expiry of her RP. How much penalty shall apply while exit from Qatar	"If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin, you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However, if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE, THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up, you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license, however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started, you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department, where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist, for a small fee). If you have entered the country on a business visa, your sponsor will need to sign the form. The documents required for a temporary license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin. * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs (remember, if you normally wear glasses, you should be wearing them in the photo) Upon presentation of the above documents you will undergo an eye test, which is performed there and then on the premises. You will need to find (not an easy task), and then pay, the cashier. The fee is QR 150 and you will need a credit card as no cash payments are accepted. You should be able to collect the license the following day. A temporary license allows you to drive rental cars, however you may not be insured to drive a privately owned car - this is purely at the discretion of the individual insurance company and they should be contacted to ensure coverage. Upon receipt of your residence visa, you will be able to apply for a permanent license, which is valid for five years. If you are caught driving without a license, the penalty is QR 100. Holders of GCC driving licenses can obtain a permanent Qatar driving license automatically, regardless of their country of origin. The majority of European and Western licenses can also be automatically exchanged; however, due to the constantly changing regulations, it is prudent to check with the traffic department at the time of applying. If you do have an exchangeable license, you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department (489 0666) and complete an application form that then needs to be typed in Arabic and signed by your sponsor. The documents required for a permanent license are: * Application form * Original license from country of origin * No objection letter from your sponsor (in Arabic) * Copy of trade license (if you are sponsored by a company) * Copy of your sponsor's ID * Original passport or your Qatar ID card * Passport copy * Three passport photographs Upon presentation of the above documents, you will undergo an eye test, which is performed immediately on the premises. Pay the cashier a fee of QR 155 (no cash payments are accepted so take your credit card!). You should be able to collect the license the following day. If you are unfortunate enough to come from a country that is not allowed to automatically exchange licenses, you will have to undergo a driving test. This involves both an oral test and a road test. The tests are conducted in manual transmission cars and there may be up to four people in the car, each one taking turns to drive. During the holy month of Ramadan ladies are not permitted to take a road test. The operating hours for the traffic department are strictly 07:00 to 11:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, however, the ladies section is only open in the morning. At closing time, you will be asked to return either in the evening or the next day, regardless of how far you are in the queue! If you are prepared to wake up early and be there at 07:00, you will find it quite quiet.

There have in the past been instances of people arriving without documents. The penalties for employing someone without the correct paperwork will be heavy. There have been amnesties in the past in Qatar. Recent cases in Abu Dhabi have also resulted in 2 months prison and a fine for sheltering such illegals.	0	Q429	Q429_R32_C3

Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67, if you have an RP here, to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days, sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa), you cannot work, and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.	0	Q430	Q430_R8_C4

For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	0	Q430	Q430_R29_C5

Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.	0	Q430	Q430_R33_C1

Presently my husband is moving with business visa and then later company will apply for work visa. He is suffering with psoriasis will it effect in clearing medical for work permit	this is a very normal thing.. once you got here your business visa should be converted to working visa. The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration, they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but , my tax when I was still working in Manila,paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!	0	Q430	Q430_R33_C7

Presently my husband is moving with business visa and then later company will apply for work visa. He is suffering with psoriasis will it effect in clearing medical for work permit	luke_137, 1) You know why does this issue exist? There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle, as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas, and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers, and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny , as an exception, it does not apply to you. Unlike others, you got your business visa legally, issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to get their share. It's like one thief is demanding from another thief to share the stolen goods, and when the second thief refuses to do so, the first thief goes to the police and complains against him. Silly! 2) You know who to be blamed? That one easy and short: YOURSELF!	0	Q430	Q430_R33_C9

"you could set appointment by bringing the copy of receipt and then they will put the date and time on it. in my case, the appointment was set 1 month after I requested for the meeting. so many reasons why application is rejected. if they have problem on your papers they will tell you, if that can still be supported by providing other documents, then they might put the status under ""postpone"" while waiting for your other papers. They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here.

But when I call those numbers they are asking blindly 10000 QAR to 17000 QAR to get the Visa approved. They dont know the value of the money, simply misguiding the peoples to loose the money.

Hi Can anyone tell the name of this marked place near Alkhor. Infact it seems to be a good park. Is it private or public? Thanks	I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places, but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place. Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from, and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do, but I can give you more specific ideas if you want. We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it, but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok. If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is. 	0	Q434	Q434_R24_C4

Hi Can anyone tell the name of this marked place near Alkhor. Infact it seems to be a good park. Is it private or public? Thanks	First you should ask your wife's opinion in that matter. You should both sit together and discuss how important this job to her and to your budget. If there are other offers, you will need to consider them as well. Also, many companies have regulations banning immediate relatives to work in the same office and for the same company sometimes, unless in different branches or separate departments. Please consider these issues: - Can you both guarantee objectivity and separation between work and home? - Can you both handle closeness all day and night long? - Are you both highly competitive which might cause jealousy between the both of you and might affect your relation?

guys does anyone know if any food mess is available in Al Aziziya.Please let me know Thank you	if you are too busy to cook, join a food mess. there is one at the Sri Lankan restaurant - Majestic for about QR300 per month which includes lunch & dinner. for breakfast, there is another Sri Lankan restaurant - Salamath ( go down the road where Anana's is located) you have to pay a monthly fee of Qr. 250 - which works more like a deposit. you can eat against the paid Qr 250. they have a separate card for each customer who joins this programme of them & at the end of every month they evaluate your total budget against the paid QR250. if you have eaten for more than the paid QR250, you have to re-pay them the balance or if you have eaten less than QR250, they will carry on the balance to the following month. how ever in both scenarios, you are also entitled for a 10% discount of what you have eaten for that particular month. also you can have all 3 meals there. how ever, it is better to contact them first :) hope this info was useful :)	0	Q435	Q435_R40_C3

But if you are into the hot and yummy then nothing quite beats it. SL food is cheap but the quality and portions are quite good. Indian food is pretty cheap too as is Arabic food.

guys does anyone know if any food mess is available in Al Aziziya.Please let me know Thank you	Not sure why there is such confusion this late in November. Home Center has the fiber optic trees (half-size) in their backroom. MegaMart near Ramada has MANY varieties of trees. Dasman still hasn't received theirs. And Carrefour can't decide whether or not to keep stocked or sell out and let the emptiness speak for itself. There are other small sales places around Doha (similar to MegaMart's multi-mini-shop method) that have some. Just don't hold your breath on a REAL wood tree. :^P	0	Q435	Q435_R46_C4

guys does anyone know if any food mess is available in Al Aziziya.Please let me know Thank you	I have had both, and the mess of the real wooden tree is worth the scent and flavor of being poked by real pine needles and enjoying the natural variety. But in Qatar, it is not worth the huge expense of getting a dried out, underbred, withered and scrawny wooden tree. Btw, Home Center in the City Centre Mall now has x3 varieties of trees (including full size), as well as many decorations. Note: Still cannot find a decent star or similar decoration for the top of my tree. Family Food carries cheap plastic types, though they DO sell the Santa caps (in Al Nasser), Mega Mart has an option though not a star.	0	Q435	Q435_R46_C9

The parties are separated into two groups, men and women, and there is no alcohol (at least at the womens parties) they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing.

guys does anyone know if any food mess is available in Al Aziziya.Please let me know Thank you	"The men's part of the wedding is pretty straight forward. Invitees congratulate the groom and his father, brothers... You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea, have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice, beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."	0	Q435	Q435_R47_C4

Thank you	I have heard from lots of people that Herbalife works really well as long as you do not eat greasy food. I have never been fat so I would not know, but I know a few guys who swear by it. ANy of you out there who can relate to my comment that Herbalife works, I think if you can say it works it might be a good way to lose weight.

Thank you	I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days... Yep counting calories and exercise works, but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation, so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies... If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-	0	Q436	Q436_R10_C7

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	No, I eat shake for breakfast with cereals and juice or milk, befor shake i took my fibres and herbs - for digestion, multivitamins and minerals!!! Than a small meal around 11am (cheese or fruit, almonds...protein bar...) and drink water because fibres needs water so your digestion would work!!!!! before my traditional lunch (Croats like to eat meat and potatos, salade, soup, dessert!!!) I took my herbs and vitamins, drink water... Around 4pm I took more fruit, almonds...protein bar..., water... And for dinner I eat my shake meal in summer strawberry flavour with fresh strawberries, ice and juice all blended in the most delicious shake you ever tried!!!! So I wasn't hungry, din't have 500 calories diet - actually I had 2000 calories diet!!!!!!!! That is important!!! And drink a lots of water (because you need it for all vital functions - 70-80% of our body is made of water :)) ), i didn't drink cola or any gas drinks - personally I don't like them and they give you cellulite :))) I don't know about other companies and their products - what they do to your body, BUT I am fully convinced in results with HERBALIFE products... Maybe if you try their shakes you would agree with me :) Ther is one IMPORTANT THING - if you want better and unbelivable result you need to exercise at least 30 minutes EVERY day - but fast walking is also an execise so that's not so hard, am i right?	0	Q436	Q436_R14_C8

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes.

IF not, you will always gain more weight than what you lost and this is why people who diet a lot tend to get fatter as they age. It is not a temporary thing. It is a lifestyle change.

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	No works outs for me...find them really boring :(. I used to go to the Corniche everyday and walk fast for two hours. I have started doing it again as it gets cooler, not so much because I want to lose weight but because it makes me feel wonderful. Wow, with two little ones no wonder you don't find the times to look after your diet. Maybe try not to skip meals, but instead doing big meals eat little things often just to speed up your metabolism? Yup, I'm skinny now, I'm happiest with my body when I'm between 50 and 55 kg.

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	i do feel good about myself, whatever i do is to boost my self image for myself a bit more and feel more happier.i had managed to lose the weight the first time round, but this time its taking a bit longer so at times feel dejected. i was thinking of jumpstarting the loss by trying actrim but cant do it since i am still feeding my baby. wow 2 hours is a good time to walk, i shud do that provided my husband agress to sit with the babies, thats the problem, not enough time. i am disciplined with home workouts, quite obsessive infact,i have my own workout figured out, but no consistency cos i do it religiously for 3 weeks, then my kids are sick for a week during which they dont leave my side and by the end of 10days they have given the infection to me. so 2 weeks is lost recuperating and i need to start all over again. this has been going on for the past 4months, and i have managed only 3kg. i too dont exercise for the figure factor, but for health as i need to, have a predisposition to diabetes and hypertension, saw both of it during my pregnancy, so its already a lifestyle change for me. i should try 2 hour walk at corniche, i love walking there no matter what weather, have u tried walking briskly during winters, its crazy, but feels good at the end of it. i used to walk for 50mins when i cud take that time out. do u have kids?	0	Q436	Q436_R25_C4
Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	mine is almost 14 months old. Last winter it was easy to go for brisk walks...you know, sit her on her stroller and just push her and run up and down the corniche...she would be asleep within ten minutes. But now she insists in getting out of the pushchair and walking as well so is a little bit more difficult!. Maybe the weith you put on during the second pregnancy takes a little bit longer to come off. Maybe you are holding onto some fat while you are still breastfeeding and it will come off once you wean your baby, I heard that happens often. Anyways 3 kg in four months sounds fine,pregnancy weight always take longer to get rid of, just keep your diet and work outs and go for walks whenever you can and I'm sure you will slim down :)	0	Q436	Q436_R25_C5

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	Its a simple equation. What you eat - energy you consume = net fat gain/loss. You either eat less or use up more energy. There is no magic potion, pill or diet. You have to make a lifestyle change. Small changes in lifestyle (substituting skimmed for full fat milk, avoiding fried food etc etc) will mean a gradual weight loss but its more likely to become permenant. Other helpful hints include increasing muscle mass to increase metabolism and eating most of your calories early on in the day. No night binging.	0	Q436	Q436_R25_C7

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	I'm not expert but I reckon at this age her nutricionial requirements should be covered during the day, she shouldn't need feeding at all during the nighttime...maybe she is just thirsty? Try giving her water everytime she wakes up. Otherwise, horrible as it sounds, maybe you can just let her cry it out. 1 year babies know how to use crying not to only to communicate basic needs but just to get some attention. Perhaps if you ignore it for a couple of nights, she will learn that crying at night will not get her what she wants (your attention) and realise that nights are for sleeping. hope it helps	0	Q436	Q436_R25_C9

Thank you	Hi Buttercuple, do away with fastfood (chips, deep fried chicken) as first they are unhealthy. I don't think there's anything wrong with rice, pasta or bread as long as you eat them in moderation. Tayo kasing mga pinoy, rice in the am, lunch and pm :), pero cguro kapag isang cup lang per serving wala nang second serving ok pa din un.

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	"There is no ""One diet for all""....we all have different body types, metabolisms, activity levels, etc... Cutting out carbs is one way to reduce your caloric intake (like the atkins diet)....but unless its a permanent change (ie lifestyle change and not just a diet for a certain period), the weight tends to return. Generally speaking (unless there are medical reasons mostly to do with metabolism), a person's weight is a function of how many calories they itake, and how many they work off (by exercising)....and exercising doesn't JUST mean the gym.... The best Advice I can give you is not to follow a pre printed diet, but go to a nutritionist who can tailor a diet for your specific body type and needs...at least that's what I would do in Canada....I don't even know if there are certified nutritionists in Qatar. Hope that helps...and whatever you decide, good luck. Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?"	0	Q436	Q436_R32_C3

Hi all please guide me to reduce my weight i am suffering from obesity 55259434 please call me if you are training any fitness classes. Thank you	everyone is differant, but to lose weight it has to be a lifstyle change as once you go of the diet you can actually put more weight back on eat sesable and exersise. A doctor once told me try to avoid worring about actually how much you weigh and go for apperance. following a low carb diet works you mainly limit the intake of what are known to be BAD carbs things like to much rice,pasta, bread dont forget there are good carbs and you need these when you exersice to help develop mussle i suggest eating a bannana before exersiceing as this gives you energy as well as helps with the fat burning procces. when switching from a poor diet to a more structured one try taking a good multi vitamin just to help kick start everything again. Also try just changing eating habits make sure you eat a good breakfast and switch your main meal to the middle of the day as thats when we require the most energy also try not to eat more than 2-3 hours before bed.	0	Q436	Q436_R32_C10

But Mustang will give you less troubles in daily routine driving.

Could you please advise any place to buy Toyota used spare parts. I need Toyota Echo 2005 model's front left power window switch. Currently; not available in the dealer. Thank you;	well i don't have any idea about renault costs, but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy is that NOTHING comes close to the reliability and low maintenance costs of japanese cars, especially toyota. they just keep going on and on and on. and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule, toyotas could run forever haha..i saw a toyota camry few days back which had been driven 798000 kms..that is absolutely and unbelievably high mileage..and the car was ten years old..i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was..all the owner did was take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drove a lot..if maintenance and cost and reliability is a concern for you, then japanese cars are the way to go. best of luck:-)	0	Q437	Q437_R20_C5
Could you please advise any place to buy Toyota used spare parts. I need Toyota Echo 2005 model's front left power window switch. Currently; not available in the dealer. Thank you;	Peace be upon you, and how do you do?. First of all, when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries, and thinking to buy a car, then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice. However, if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car, then buy a small Japanese Sedan/Saloon car, as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars, specailly here in the Arabian Gulf, as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future. SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota, but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money, so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan. Nevertheless, no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy, but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for 35 years and had and experince with many types of cars, then it is better for you to think more before you buy any european car in here, and no matter what kind of european car you are going to buy, keep in your mind that workshops and spare parts for that kind of cars is going to keep sucking the money from your pockets, and what ever you do for such a car, it can't survive without alot of maintinance, and this could take alot of your money, precious time, and a contious headache till it makes you hate the car, then when it is time to sell the car, for sure the price may go down so fast, Also not much of people could be intersted in. Although, it is not just about the car spare parts or maintinance. Also there is another problem which is about the unbelieveable raised prices for all types of tyres for all kinds of vehicles here in Qatar ?!, So you have to think about this too. Finally, you were right to ask about the car maintinace and spare parts, as this is a very good point for any person who would think to buy a car. As a matter in fact it is the first thing we have to ask about before buying any car, no matter what offers the car's dealers are attracting customers with, but the most important what is going to happen to the car after it runs on the road and experince the real heat in the traffic, .....etc. By the way, thanks for this topic as it is an important subject to discuss. Take care and may God bless you. Best wishes abd good luck. *RED	0	Q437	Q437_R20_C6

Camry 2007 is great looking and will re-sell at the highest price...BUT..you will have 100s around you in taxis and it handles like a sofa...Service is OK..but when you have 1000 locals with Land Cruisers in Queue..expect less than perfect delivery on promised times..... Altima is good looking too..but its been around for 3 years now..and cosmetic changes are shoddy....Best airconditioning ..Stable but soft ride...Good Handling..poor service at Doha... Honda don't get it...whenever cosmetic changes are made..the result is worse than the original..Accord 2005 was great looking and Honda degraded it in 2006..Best engine..Great performance..Dodgy handling...Below par Interiors...Best service in Doha...

Staff was very cooperative and the price reasonable. next stop was the nissan showroom where the service was superb. The altima 2.5 had all the features offered with the camry and honda but the price was much less. rear parking sensors were offered free along with blue tooth.

He is diagonsed with HFATS - high functioning autistic traights spectrum. he is joining me by last week October'07. There are just 4 neurologists in this country. I will write their names tomorrow as I do not have them handy rigth now. there is one Neurosurgeon in Doha clinic - he is more of a doctor for orthopaedic patients. Second is a lady neuro paedratic. She is in UK for her knee transplant an should be back in Doha in first week Nov'07. I did meet both of them and their feed back is neuro care is absolutely zero in Doha. There are two more neurologists in Hamad hospital. Havent met them yet. Shafallah center is for complete mentally challenged kids. I met the officials there and they would not do any OT training to outside kids. The kid has to study there and that is where our kids are different from the kids there in Shafallah.

Hi I am looking for a good children psychologist in Doha. Please help if you have any experience. Thank you.	The choices for support of special needs are limited here, folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed, qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but, again, populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it). I recently found an Occupational Therapist here, but it was HARD. There is a local group of expat specialists (mostly therapists, psychologists, etc.) that meet, and they do have links/references to other people here for those needing referrals, but families moving here from the States/UK/elsewhere need to know that if your child needs a lot of specialized support, then you're better off staying home. If anyone wants/needs more info, please email me for specifics. Cheers --	0	Q438	Q438_R5_C9

Hi I am looking for a good children psychologist in Doha. Please help if you have any experience. Thank you.	Regarding the starting salary,if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas, that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1,000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha, then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals.

That sticker will be on all passport and the important thing is you should check with the mandoob or immigration direct if it is processed or under processing or not yet and if processed then you can not leave and even if you leave you get a ban of 2 years and if under processing it means the same as it is processed because it is undergoing and if not processed then you can leave and check with your mandoob	0	Q439	Q439_R3_C8

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	0	Q439	Q439_R7_C9

"Buddy, go through your contract, signed and agreed between you and your employer. Read thoroughly the clauses especially the ""Termination of Contract"". In normal course, either party can terminate the contract with 1 to 7days notice subject to the terms and conditions specified on the contract. If you terminate the contract within the probation period, you will have to pay a lump sum amount to the employer towards the cost of visa, medical, and other expenses if any. Also you will have to buy the ticket from your pocket. However the employer has no right to hold u back but can ban you for 2 years without providing an NOC.

I have a question my self & it is related here though I already posted it to questions & answers but it seems no one is really visiting that part of QL so... My company got this habit of delaying people from the date of resignation so they obviously knows about the two weeks max limit of Qatar labor code's article 57.

I have a 6 month probation period - I have been in Doha for 4 months. If I resign; do I have to pay my company back recruitment costs; visa costs; etc?	every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period, the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps	0	Q439	Q439_R21_C4

Very Frankly saying, Don't think about legal action. it will never work. gratuity per year is of 21 days. So if you didn't took it previously, you will get all your dues.

I have a 6 month probation period - I have been in Doha for 4 months. If I resign; do I have to pay my company back recruitment costs; visa costs; etc?	Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01, 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so, the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22,093.15 Apart from this, your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that, 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.	0	Q439	Q439_R21_C9

I have a 6 month probation period - I have been in Doha for 4 months. If I resign; do I have to pay my company back recruitment costs; visa costs; etc?	regarding probationary period and contract termination. Usually, there are provisions for terminating contract by either party. The most important thing here is sincerity, and I hope the family problem you are mentioning is real. I read some of your past comments on some threads and I'm really having a second thought about your real intention. Actually, it should have been a different story if you had not submitted a resignation letter but since you have already, my advice is, if you are still within the probationary period, submit a letter of termination for your contract or submit an irrevocable resignation stating your reasons. Then study the Qatar Labor Law as to what are the consequences of such actions. But do not abscond but wait 'til they accept your letter.

Saeedkan is correct, your boss finds you suitable for your job, that is why he is having a hard time, or even already decided to keep you within the company. I can suggest, apply for an EMERGENCY LEAVE, that way at least, you can assure your boss that you are coming back. Once in the Philippines, way all your options and decide if you are coming back or not, but still THE BEST WAY IS TO COME BACK, of course, for you and for your family's good. Definitely, your boss wants to keep you, so the best way is to assure him your coming back. In that way he will have peace and no worries.	0	Q439	Q439_R51_C10

In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times...

The original reason for QP offering temporary fully furnished accommodation for the initial period was so that incoming staff had the opportunity to settle in to the country and get a feel for what housing was available and where.

I have a 6 month probation period - I have been in Doha for 4 months. If I resign; do I have to pay my company back recruitment costs; visa costs; etc?	I totally agree with tg, Sometimes things happen and this is not unusual here in Qatar. I know many people who resigned from their jobs hoping they will get the visa quickly and took up to 4 months. I work at HMC, they have their own immigration section and yet still they got me a visa in 6 weeks!!!!! so DO NOT ever ever ever resign your job and stay home until you really see your visa number with your two eyes ;) Good luck	0	Q439	Q439_R75_C9

"Semi government means QP, RasGas, Al Jazeera etc. If it is an admin job (secretary, coordinator etc) you can almost forget it. Even jobs out of Qatarization are having difficulty. Problem is you cannot go for CID clearance for a new job until you resign from the old one. New regulations in most companies now is that if you dont get CID clearance within 2 months they will let you go. If you are going to a private company no need for this.

"Not so Qatarisun, unfortunately 2 of my Canadian friends and at least 20 Brits have been rejected by CID in the last year, and new recruits stand little chance at all.

Really thanks for you interaction with the subject.

I have a 6 month probation period - I have been in Doha for 4 months. If I resign; do I have to pay my company back recruitment costs; visa costs; etc?	Usually the longest probationary period is 6 months, but before you started to work in any company you must sign a contract first... and really I don't know how they can transfer your visa under their sponsorship without contract!!! You can leave without prior notice, just submit your resignation, ask them to prepare your exit permit and do not to go to work the following day. But you will not able to get your money in this company. Anyway, they can deny their commitment to you, also in the end they may not give you your final settlement or other compensation! So better talk to your HR Manager/ GM regarding your concern and ask them your status to the company, and at least give you reason why until now there is no contract until this time and when they will provide it. Contract is the only security we have as expats!!!	0	Q439	Q439_R94_C8

Hi all; I want to change the sponsorship to new company.My current Company is blacklisted.so i cannot transfer the sponsorship. can any one have idea about this problem.please help me Thanks;	Thanks Guys..finally I got approval for my wife and baby's visit visa. @ Mary-vani, the education certificates are not required for visit visa application. Of course they are looking for marriage and baby's birth certificate attestation. So the requirements as per my experience goes here.... 0) Application for Wife & child from the typing center. (don't forget to sign) 1) NOC from Company. 2) Contract Copy. 3) Own Passport copy, Wife's passport copy and child passport copy. 4) Attested Marriage certificate copy. 5) Attested Child's Birth Certificate copy. That's all... N.B: Separate application and the above set of documents for individuals.	0	Q440	Q440_R14_C10

Hi all; I want to change the sponsorship to new company.My current Company is blacklisted.so i cannot transfer the sponsorship. can any one have idea about this problem.please help me Thanks;	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q440	Q440_R17_C4

Hi all; I want to change the sponsorship to new company.My current Company is blacklisted.so i cannot transfer the sponsorship. can any one have idea about this problem.please help me Thanks;	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q440	Q440_R17_C10
Hi all; I want to change the sponsorship to new company.My current Company is blacklisted.so i cannot transfer the sponsorship. can any one have idea about this problem.please help me Thanks;	As far as i know, that is not so difficult.  If you know any mandoub, ask him for help and explain that you want to sponsor someone not related to you. Even your travel agent can arrange for it.  Al Deera is one example.  They can book you in Al Maha Services at the airport.  They will provide everything from visa processing up to clearing at immigration here at the airport. You have to check if her nationality is among those who are being granted visa at the airport. Examples are: ·         USA ·         Greece ·         France ·         Germany ·         Sweden ·         Italy   If not, then you have to process at least 3 days prior to her departure.	0	Q440	Q440_R26_C1

They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here.

But when I call those numbers they are asking blindly 10000 QAR to 17000 QAR to get the Visa approved. They dont know the value of the money, simply misguiding the peoples to loose the money.

Hi all; I want to change the sponsorship to new company.My current Company is blacklisted.so i cannot transfer the sponsorship. can any one have idea about this problem.please help me Thanks;	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ...

No matter what papers you will provide (bank statements showing that you can spend there $10,000 in 1 week or undertaking letter from your job that they guarantee your return), by the way dutchess01 no matter who is your sponsor in Qatar either...For example, if you are egyptian/lebanese/syrian (or indian/srilankian/philipino, etc...) single guy of 25-26 y.o...or so.. then FORGET ABOUT IT.. unless you are sooo much lucky… and if you DO get a visa by the chance, it's a very rare exception rather than the rule. sometimes they even reject to give a visitor's visa to the spouse of the american or canadian citizen...it's also pretty common practice... so guys relax and go to Maldives for your vacation...lol.... the only Company who can get a visa to US (the business one)relatively easy is Microsoft, as these guys are supported by Bill Gates..lol... *********************** [img_assist|nid=71431|title=This Too Shall Pass|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]	0	Q440	Q440_R36_C5

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	guys thanks for your replies ... molten I would feel better and mainly i ll be more productive while having my kids crying ''near by'' rather than spending my day worrying and imagining the worst. Obviously these companies have separate organized daycare places it's not like bring your kid to office day ... We have some companies like that in Morocco and I'm thinking there must be some in here as well Boxbe I respect your point of view but I totally disagree with it, daycare can only help reduce the stress level for working moms (and some dads whom care enough) , just like having a staff lounge or a gym. It ll mak business a little more human I don't see why it should reflect any negativity on its image. Unless you think a woman's place is at home etc ... then I won't debate it. Its true my kids need me that's why im searching for better job environment khalliwalli ... i really hope u r wrong. i don't see why they wouldn't do it since Qatar is pretty much family oriented .. from what i have seen. and it's not like they can't afford it ?	0	Q441	Q441_R39_C3

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	Boxbe do you really wana be this judgmental and question the need for a mother ? daycare is what parents want it to be. Not everyone see it as a way to get rid of their own kids. It is a way safer way to return to work rather that maids. I have seen horrors in some nurseries which were not cheap at all so I wouldn't put my children in there for anything in this world. So yeah mothers might need help with the kids but it doesn't make us unfit it just makes us human. Molten I have made the choice to be at home since I had my first son and I thought I would do it again. 2 twins later i'm being outnumbered by babies even with a maid and let's face it money is gona be a major issue soon. bringing my mom was temporary and expensive ... we are expats there is no cousins sisters around ... so we need a permanent solution. i should say my elder (1.5 yr) enjoys other toddlers company so it ll be a great way for him to socialize.. the high heels noise is a good point though	0	Q441	Q441_R39_C7

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	Better to leave your kids at home with an illiterate maid who beats your kids than in a workplace controlled daycare center staffed by professionals. That's the mentality in this country. You can tell by the way the kids behave in the malls! Unfortunately Samia most of the people in this country still believe that a woman should be in the home cooking and cleaning, and sadly they actually don't even know what a workplace childcare facility would mean.

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	"Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School. If they get accepted then leave the UK. This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school, they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals. Sadly, the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints."	0	Q441	Q441_R42_C1

DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me , no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College, Parkhouse, Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference, I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available, do prepare to fly them immediately.	0	Q441	Q441_R42_C2

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However, this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)	0	Q441	Q441_R42_C7
Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	"I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage, Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list."	0	Q441	Q441_R42_C8

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	"Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 ""best"" schools in doha, based on what, usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay, as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools. I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD (no chance) but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better feeling about the ethos of the school."	0	Q441	Q441_R42_C10

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	hello guys,Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child,they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them,they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam,its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future.

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses, even the ones in which small kids travel, and even after complaining to the school many times, there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues related to school transport etc. Its time parents come together and initiate some action.	0	Q441	Q441_R59_C9

There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place, and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny, which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with.

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	Welcome to Doha and congratulations for ur pregnancy. I would like to take this opportunity and talk about bare facts regarding Autism care in Doha. My son is 7 years old and is undergoing OT in India. He is diagonsed with HFATS - high functioning autistic traights spectrum. he is joining me by last week October'07. There are just 4 neurologists in this country. I will write their names tomorrow as I do not have them handy rigth now. there is one Neurosurgeon in Doha clinic - he is more of a doctor for orthopaedic patients. Second is a lady neuro paedratic. She is in UK for her knee transplant an should be back in Doha in first week Nov'07. I did meet both of them and their feed back is neuro care is absolutely zero in Doha. There are two more neurologists in Hamad hospital. Havent met them yet. Shafallah center is for complete mentally challenged kids. I met the officials there and they would not do any OT training to outside kids. The kid has to study there and that is where our kids are different from the kids there in Shafallah. There is a lady ortho paedic doctor in Rumailah hospital, she would / could be a guide for our kid's problem.	0	Q441	Q441_R68_C7

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	The choices for support of special needs are limited here, folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed, qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but, again, populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it). I recently found an Occupational Therapist here, but it was HARD. There is a local group of expat specialists (mostly therapists, psychologists, etc.) that meet, and they do have links/references to other people here for those needing referrals, but families moving here from the States/UK/elsewhere need to know that if your child needs a lot of specialized support, then you're better off staying home. If anyone wants/needs more info, please email me for specifics. Cheers --	0	Q441	Q441_R68_C9

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	Never leave your kids with a babysitter. Kindergartens are safer and teach your children various skills and knowledge. Read the newspapers, there have been many issues with Nannies abusing the children in their care.

Hello; I wanted to know if there are any schools in Qatar in which there is a day care (for 1 year old child) within the school premises?	It really is a personal decision and there are no wrongs or rights here.I can only speak of my experience and let you decide from there. We have 2 children one in pre4 at school and the other 3 still at home. We have a nanny who takes care of the 3 year old. We went through the newspaper and interviewed about 20 and had about 40 call. Out of 20 there were about 3 we would have gone with. We decided on one and it was O.K. but after about 2 or 3 weeks we let her go. Were going to do add again but through contacts in the building and info from our pervious add campaign we found another nanny. It has been about 6 months now and all is good. We need to revisit expectations once in a while but overall we are pleased. We have play dates arranged each week for the nanny to take our child and we have other expectations that we hope insure a nuturing and healthy day. There is good and bad to both senerios. My wife stayed home for a year when our son was 1.5 because we didn't like the kindergarden and the colds he got from parents who sent there child to school obviously ill. But rather than moan about it we just tightened the wallet and buckled down for a year. So I know both senerios, depends on you. I'd suggest here in this country you should do a lot of screening but get a nanny. Salary ranges from 1200Q to 2000Q a month for live out and working 5 or 6 days a week. Depends on your accomadations if she will live with you. If she lives with you, it would be cheaper. If you consider anything I say relevant feel free to ask for an e-mail to talk, otherwise My response will piss off someone and we'll need to read a string of comments on blah blah blah.	0	Q441	Q441_R72_C2

I want to make health insurance that include dental and to be activated quickly other than hamad ..any suggestions about companies ;prices how to proceed	Hi I am a British expat living and working in Doha for 12 years and we have always had our local health card costing Qr 100 . People are spoilt here with having private insurance and don't know how good the local services are. Why pay for a private clinic.? All they are interested in is making profit. Go to the government run clinics and everything is subsidised by the government here. Money is no object! You get the best. I have had two major operations done here in Hamad hospital. I have been going to a local clinic for 12 years and had excellent care. They refer you straight to a specialist if they suspect anything wrong. I have had in the last month a colonoscopy, and endoscopy , seen a heart specialist and had a complete medical to check there is nothing going on that could cause future problems. All because I am over 50 and these checks can save lives in the future. Excellent care here. This would never happen in the UK. You would be on a wait list for a year at least to just see one specialist and have one procedure. Each procedure , done under sedation only cost me Qr75 . For a paltry sum of Qr100 I recommend the health care in Qatar. Of course you wait a little when you go for your check up. Not like the private hospitals, but for the standard of care here it's well worth it.	0	Q442	Q442_R12_C6

There are lots of good hospitals here, so it is not a problem. However, I think you need proof of vaccination in small kids before you entry the country. I may be wrong.

I want to make health insurance that include dental and to be activated quickly other than hamad ..any suggestions about companies ;prices how to proceed	If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here, now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But, if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example, in the US they don't do BCGs, but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer, but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!	0	Q442	Q442_R148_C2

I want to make health insurance that include dental and to be activated quickly other than hamad ..any suggestions about companies ;prices how to proceed	"I went to 3 places... Hamad, Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while, and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance, I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week, so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first, so bring the baby's RP, birth certificate, etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance, I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid, he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area, my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when we went there for vaccines. But the private hospitals are expensive if you don't have insurance to cover the vaccines. No need to worry, you have lots of choices here. Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 different opinions about the doctors and hospitals. Just look around for one you are comfortable with, and needing to do the vaccines is a good excuse to check out Doctors for the time when you need one for your sick baby."	0	Q442	Q442_R148_C7

Can I transfer to another company after 2 months if the company gives NOC	don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan, there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also, they might have ways to find and go after you, you never know.	0	Q443	Q443_R72_C8

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q444	Q444_R3_C4

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q444	Q444_R3_C10

My husband's QID is technician, but he finished with a degree, the immigration asked us to change his profession on qid first before proceeding with RP application. We have tried/submitted multiple times the application for the change of profession but is still being denied. Now they are asking for Certificate of Equivalency.

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	hi there! just some clarifications...i know those who are in family visit visa have the privilege for a 1 month stay and can get it extended for 5 months. Im quite confused with the 2 months entry and 1 month stay...? extension maybe?..that might be a business visa i guess. Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status...? Maybe what the company meant was they accept applicants or workers only for those with husband visa sponsorship...Anyway look for company which can provide a working visa, if you do have more time.

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	Families of sponsored residents may enter Qatar on a short-term Family Visit Visa. The visa is valid for one month. However, relatives who wish to stay beyond one month may undergo a physical examination within the first 72 hours of arrival to apply for an extension. The visa can be extended to cover a maximum of six months only (five extendable months for immediate family members and two months for second-degree relatives).	0	Q444	Q444_R47_C3

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Dear Friends ; Any body can tell me How many days we need to apply Family Visit visa at second time after they leaving Qatar after first visit ??? Azhar.E.A.	What you need to prepare: • Approval letter from your company immigration with regards to sponsoring visit visa. • Copy of your passport • Copy of the passport of the one you're about to visit Salary Statement in English for Embassy purposes Steps on how to process your application: • Go to Immigration Department in Gharafa • Go to the Typing Section and state that you would like to visit someone (present to him the letter from your company immigration, copy of your passport & copy of the passport of the one you're about to visit) pay him 10Qrs. • Go to Building 4 for the processing and issuance of visa. • If you will visit someone in direct connection with you (i.e. father, mother, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter) they will issue directly the visa from building 4. But if you will visit someone which is not in direct connection with you (i.e. Auntie, Uncle, Cousin, Friend) you will need approval from the Director from Building 1, 1st floor. • The timings in the Immigration Department is from 6:30am - 1:00pm & 3:00pm - 7:00pm; For the visa you need to pay 200Qrs. and check the availability of the Visa thru www.moi.gov.qa/site/... after 3hours of issuance of receipt. For Filipino Citizens: You need to prepare Affidavit of Support that you can get from the Philippine Embassy Doha. You just have to present to them your salary statement, copy of your passport & the one that you're about to visit, this will take you 1day for the processing of Affidavit of Support. This Affidavit of Support will be presented by the one you're about to visit in the Immigration Section at the NAIA. What does the one that you're about to visit need to do? • He/She needs to send to Qatar Embassy to the Philippines thru DHL these things: • Original Passport, • 2pcs. 2x2 ID picture with white background, • Printed visa copy and wait for 5 working days till they send you back your passport with visa sticker. Coming to Doha: He/She needs to bring His/Her Passport, Affidavit of Support, Copy of the sponsor passport, ticket & money.	0	Q444	Q444_R56_C6

Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi, My husband and I both have jobs at AKIS for September 2010. We are coming from Melbourne, Australia and are both PE teachers. We are both really excited about it. Thats great you have some contacts there already. What do they say about living in the Community and the school? What do you teach and where are you from? Nice to make contact with you :)	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C2
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi there! Exciting isn't it? We are coming from New Zealand although we are poms. This is supposed to be a stop off on the way back to the UK. I'm going to teach Technology. The Principal (Lyal) was the principal who employed me here! Apparently the compound is good, the place to be if you have kids. Been doing as much research as I can, been comparing prices in the supermarkets there and here and am pleased to find it is much cheaper there. Andy	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C3
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi Andy, Good to hear from you. My husband is from the UK too, I am Australian. We will be going with our two young kids (2 years and 5 months) Thats good to hear that food is cheaper there. Anything else interesting you have read? How long have you been in NZ? Enjoyed it? The Community sounds great doesn't it! Seems like there will be lots of things to do. Mel	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C4
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi Mel, I guess most of the stuff that I have learned so far about AKIS and Qatar is probably the same as you. Actually finding out stuff seems difficult compared to most things on the internet. Lots of stuff seems to be out of date and this forum seems mostly full of people that struggle to put a sentence together (for whatever reason). We have found NZ to be an interesting experience but we miss our family and friends and financially we have been worse off. Food is especially expensive here, so it is good to find it cheaper there. I have been told that because the restaurants in the community are subsidised you can eat well for a couple of dollars! The school seems to have the same 'politics' issues of any school, so I guess it all depends on who you end up being mates with as to how bearable it is. Where in the UK is your husband from and what prompted the move? If you want to use email rather than this hopeless website my address is evansfamilynz@xtra.co.nz Found anyone else going yet?	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C5
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi Andy, I will drop you an email soon. No, we don't know of anyone else going there. Did you read the forum from last year of the bunch of teachers leaving from the UK? I found that quite interesting. Do you have any kids? Will your wife be working too? Do you know what the child care options are? My husband was born in Ireland but grew up in Coventry and has been here for 4 years. We have been talking for ages about working overseas and thought we would just give it a go and see if anything came up. The Middle East sounded good from a tax free point of view and also because it was only one flight away from the UK. We plan to visit our relatives there quite often. Mel :)	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C6
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi Mel, yes I saw that posting about the teachers all heading out on the same flight. I imagine there are just as many this year but I guess they haven't found this thread/found this website/want to remain anonymous! We have 2 kids, both boys (13 & 9), we haven't told them yet, that is a job for this holiday. Not quite sure what their reaction will be but I am sure they will be pleased to be closer to their family. We have booked flights to the UK at the end of July and will be spending 5 weeks there before getting the plane to Doha. Gill is trained as a junior teacher but hasn't done that for a while. I think she is hoping to get something in the school once we get there, I'm sure it makes more financial sense for them to employ people who are already there, we'll see. The guy I know there who is head of Geography says that because his wife is also teaching there they have found child care quite tough and have struggled with getting the home/work balance right. So I think it will make sense for Gill to be around when the kids finish school to start with. All a bit of an unknown. Have been looking at supermarket sites for food prices and it looks to be half the price of here which is good. Flights on the other hand are pretty expensive. Flights to the UK at Xmas for the 4 of us comes to QR10500 which is a sizeable chunk, not cheap like EasyJet. Am wondering how easy running will be in those temperatures! Probably have to run in the middle of the night. Any other thoughts? Or questions that I can ask Nigel for you?	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C7
Please inform the best fresh Fish restaurant for family	Hi Andy, Good luck telling the kids. I hope they think it is good news. I am guessing your kids will be going to AKIS? Yes, running could be interesting. Might just have to settle for the treadmill in the gym for most of the year. What did you mean that your friends have found child care tough? That is my only concern about the move over there, that the kids are going to be ok. I know there is the AKIS Nursery, would you mind asking your friend about child care for under 2 years? Enjoy the holidays in NZ! :)	0	Q446	Q446_R84_C8

Hi Everyone I am new to qatar ; i need to send money to india so which is the best exchange which gives better rate and where is it located.	i use alsayrafa exchange at the souq. charge is only QAR 12 bank to bank. it usually takes 3 days for major banks. they have western union services too but i'm a cheapo. when my dad was still here, he sent money one time and my mom (quite irresponsibly) didn't inform us that she changed her bank account number. my mom is also not in the habit of checking her account balance so she usually cannot answer us if the remittance has been credited or not before she changed her account. alsayrafa was considerate enough to contact my dad and said the remittance won't go through. we wouldn't have known what happened to the money if they didn't call my dad. alfardan is okay too and i used to send from there, but i had a friend who had some sort of discrepancy with his bank account name and the bank in the phils won't accept the remittance. after a few days of wondering why the money hasn't been credited, he wouldn't have known the reason if he didn't check and ask them. it's probably not a big deal and ultimately it is our responsibility to confirm these things but still...i'm not sure if alfardan would've contacted my friend eventually though, or if other exchanges do these things as well.	0	Q447	Q447_R5_C6

According to my experience, open NRI direct account with commercial Bank & ICICI bank, this gives you current account in commercial bank, NRE account in ICICI bank & if you are interested in Share/mutual fund online trading then ICICI online trading account facility is best. you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your ICICI NRE account online & transfer happens in one working day. Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer, Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank, so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account & This transfer is also fast, most of the time one working day.	0	Q447	Q447_R40_C4

The embassy staff asked her to renew her passport because her country came out with a new one, she got the new passport went back they laughed at her and said: come back on Sunday when she went back, they simply told her we're not giving you a visa, not fair. the poor thing really wanted to go see her inlaws she never met them.

When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250.

She eats th same food as us, has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation.

His price was very reasonable, a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall, and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred, but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully, and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him, but as with any move, supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better, by yourself.

Hardly reliable, so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside, I tried Runway International.

We left to UK and later we were shocked to know that this guy from Runway International demanding more money else he said he is not going to ship my consignment. I had no other alternative but to transfer money. He said my shipment will reach me in 45-60 days but in reality it reached us in 98 days. Once we received our items we were shocked to see that the boxes were tampered, opened and repacked. We realize that our items have been stolen. When we asked this guy from Runway International he said he is not responsible and asked us to claim through insurance. We spent almost 4 months in constant calls, emails and communications. Never got straight forward response from Runway International. I would recommend not to go with such companies and avoid them.

Anyone know of a company that can clear your house of furniture/appliances/misc when leaving Doha?	I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company, but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content, like DVD's, VHS tapes, books, CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	0	Q448	Q448_R17_C4

Anyone know of a company that can clear your house of furniture/appliances/misc when leaving Doha?	Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha, the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items, they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.	0	Q448	Q448_R17_C8

Anyone know of a company that can clear your house of furniture/appliances/misc when leaving Doha?	Flor I don't believe what you are saying. The law only says you must provide 30 days notice, otherwise they could deduct the equivalent of that salary off your end of service entitlements. Guys please, READ THE LAW! (see art 49, part 2) which regulates the advance notice period. Article 57 stipulates that employers have the obligation of repatriating their workers. NO CONTRACT CAN OVERRIDE THESE ARTICLES! Article (49) If the service contract is of an indefinite duration any of the two parties thereto may terminate it without giving the reasons for the termination. In this case the party intending to terminate the contract shall notify the other party in writing as follows:­ 1. In respect of the workers who receive their wages annually or monthly, the notification shall be given not less than one month prior to the date of the termination. If the period of service is five years or less. If the period of service is more than five years, the notification period shall be at least two months prior to the date of termination. 2. In all other cases the notification shall be given in accordance with the following periods : A) If the period of service is less than one year the notification period shall be at least one week. B) If the period of service is more than one year and less than five years the notification period shall be at least two weeks. C) If the service period is more than five years the notification period shall be at least one month. If the contract is terminated without observing these periods, the party terminating the contract shall be obligated to compensate the other party for an amount equivalent to the wage for the notice period or the remaining part thereof. Article (57) Upon termination of the service of the worker the employer shall at his cost return him to the place from where he has recruited him at the commencement of the engagement or to any place agreed upon between the parties. The employer shall complete the proceedings of returning the non­Qatari worker within a period not exceeding two weeks from the expiry date of the contract. If the worker joins another employer before his departure from the State the obligation to return him to his country or other place shifts to the latter employer. The employer shall bear the costs of preparing the corpse of the deceased worker and the conveyance thereof to his country or place of residence upon the demand of his heirs. If the employer does not repatriate the worker or his corpse after his death as the case may be the Department shall return the worker or his corpse at the cost of the employer and recover the said costs through the administrative means.	0	Q448	Q448_R50_C7

But if the contract is 2-years, then the corresponding amount may be more than expected. That's why I said, he may shoulder his ticket as he has not finished his contract.

Anyone know of a company that can clear your house of furniture/appliances/misc when leaving Doha?	Don, I'm English but living in Turkey. I spent 15 years with the old (Qatar General Petroleum Corporation...now QP and that covers the entire oil/gas sector) and yes there are ups and downs. Social provisions (Company facilities) have deteriorated over the years but the developments in Qatar have probably made up for that. Another plus is that the country is now far more tolerant of Western behaviour and habits. Be warned about the housing costs. QP at one time provided free housing and utilities (including phone line rental). They then applied a limit to electricity and water useage after which you pay and I'm not sure if they pay for the phone line now (unless it's required for the job). If housing is provided I suggest that you take it. You will see from other posts how the cost of housing has risen. Ask QP all the questions to which you require answers. Whatever you decide to do.......... good luck.	0	Q448	Q448_R68_C6

Hi; I am in need of a medical card for my wife. she is under my sponsorship. please suggest the best card available with cost and features. Thank you	It's a really crappy company, divided and having problems with their staff, and they treat the stewardesses really bad. Latest news is that a memo was circulated last week that bans the stewardesses for doing anything than staying at home when on standby, and that they need to get 12 hours of rest before each flight. This leaves them without a social life. The administration and and management treat everyone like garbage - in Europe this would be impossible but here its the way it is, they can always get some more Indians or Easter European. In the lastest 6 months 25 - 33 % of the staff has resigned or been fired so they always need new people.

Hi; I am in need of a medical card for my wife. she is under my sponsorship. please suggest the best card available with cost and features. Thank you	Hi I am a British expat living and working in Doha for 12 years and we have always had our local health card costing Qr 100 . People are spoilt here with having private insurance and don't know how good the local services are. Why pay for a private clinic.? All they are interested in is making profit. Go to the government run clinics and everything is subsidised by the government here. Money is no object! You get the best. I have had two major operations done here in Hamad hospital. I have been going to a local clinic for 12 years and had excellent care. They refer you straight to a specialist if they suspect anything wrong. I have had in the last month a colonoscopy, and endoscopy , seen a heart specialist and had a complete medical to check there is nothing going on that could cause future problems. All because I am over 50 and these checks can save lives in the future. Excellent care here. This would never happen in the UK. You would be on a wait list for a year at least to just see one specialist and have one procedure. Each procedure , done under sedation only cost me Qr75 . For a paltry sum of Qr100 I recommend the health care in Qatar. Of course you wait a little when you go for your check up. Not like the private hospitals, but for the standard of care here it's well worth it.	0	Q449	Q449_R130_C6

hai all... how much time will it take for sponsorship change form private to semi government ; after submitting all documents like noc;pcc etc.. thank you	Mine was rejected because of Qatarization issues. Since the company I am joining is not meeting its target, the Ministry of Labour decided to block most of its overseas hiring, therefore mine was blocked. It took them around 9 days to issue the rejection, and then 4 more days to change their mind when my company submitted a letter inviting them to review the situation. What I would say is that your application is stuck with the CID normally. It might take them few more days to process your papers. In the meantime ask your company if this is normal. If they tell you this is fine you do not need to worry about it then it is fine. The only problem would be to manage your situation financially during this time, as I assume you are now paying your own rent.	0	Q450	Q450_R53_C9

Hi everyone ; can you suggest me any 2nd hand car except tiida and sunny? I am looking a car which costs around 15000 to 25000; and lower than 100000 km millage. Thanks	OMG if i wanted to put my kids on the school bus, it would collect my kids an hour and a half before school starts. They would have to sit on that bus going around the houses having probably woken up about 5am in the morning !!!!!!!! Then of course they would have the same long and tedious journey home!!!!!! If they car in a private car the journey takes takes only 35 mins! Now tell me what would you choose, bus or car??? Alot of employees are also given their accommodation and are unable to live near the school and this in turn increases the volume of traffic on the roads. We could also ask, why are so many schools built next to each other. It is not unusual to see 6 schools built right next to each other and drop off and pick up is nothing short of a nightmare. I can't understand why planning permission has been given to allow this! Personally i think that schools and offices should have different starting times but that's only my opinion.	0	Q451	Q451_R40_C5

Hi everyone ; can you suggest me any 2nd hand car except tiida and sunny? I am looking a car which costs around 15000 to 25000; and lower than 100000 km millage. Thanks	We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day, I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something, then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here, mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder, if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities, will they be more wiling to secure their kids?	0	Q451	Q451_R80_C6

Thanks	Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.	0	Q451	Q451_R80_C8
Hi everyone ; can you suggest me any 2nd hand car except tiida and sunny? I am looking a car which costs around 15000 to 25000; and lower than 100000 km millage. Thanks	Hi, I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat , even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant, I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally support this restriction. I also found out that the local councils can lease them for up to six months so that parents won't have to buy them. But i guess even if we have these kinds of assisstance, some parents just wont be able to see the need for them or worse they would just see it as a waste of money. Due to the non-existent regulation for the standard of car seats in Malaysia, I have come across a few models from China that I believe does not conform to even the most basic safety standard. They are there because people want to buy them cheap but they are as good as not having your child in a car seat. My child's car seat travles with him if we go to countries that doesn't rent them out. I guess I make my own laws where car seats are concerned. It's better to be safe than sorry.	0	Q451	Q451_R80_C9

Thanks	I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.	0	Q451	Q451_R80_C10

If you go and make complain and if you are not claiming full insurance then you will get the papers immediately. The police will just look at the damage make a report and ask you to put a QR5/- stamp. Thats all you just take the paper and go to any garage of your choice. Other wise you may have to wait for a few days sometimes as less as 3 and after that they will give you the report. I think if you are going to claim insurance then you need to pay QR 100/- at the traffic dept I think before they give you the paper to take to the insurance company.	0	Q452	Q452_R21_C3

So as a follow-up point to this, in Qatar, even if you physically damage your own vehicle on accident (back into a lamp post, get too close to the pole, etc. etc.), you have to go get a police certificate to have the damage fixed? I'm not saying OP damaged their own car, but just curious. I didn't think the 2/10 laws coming in changed accident procedures in that way. I thought it was traffic safety stuff which got changed. Or that's how it sounded in the newspaper, anyway.	0	Q452	Q452_R21_C4

Does the new traffic department in Wakrah replace damaged car number plate?. If not where can I get it done.	"my few experience : 1) I had noise on my Honda steering, plus steering was hard, i visited one mechanic in industrial area, he asked for QAR 400 for fixing... then i went to another mechanic, he asked for QAR 1500 ! said, i need to replace the entire unit including some belts (?)... then i went to third mechanic, and he found it was nothing... just power steering oil was to fill. and he fixed it in just 2 minutes and i was very happy to pay him QAR 50. my cost was dropped from 1500 to 50 Riyals ! 2) another incident, the vehicle was giving noise while putting in reverse gear. I went to the same mechanic who earlier had fixed steering problem just in 2 minute, and he asked for some checkup in German Computer. I did the checkup and computer gave an error code with description ""reverse solenoid blaa blaa blaa"". I presented the report to him, he said, the gearbox has to open and replace some switch inside and asked for the spare part from Honda + 500 Riyals for labour charge and 2 days time for fixing. I just thought to see another mechanic also. I went to another mechanic (auto electrician), he checked the code and said, there is loose connection or cable broken somewhere... he fixed the car in less than 30 minutes and asked for 100 Riyals only ! 3) least but not last case... recently, after changing the engine oil, the low oil pressure signal started to flash. i visited an mechanic, he said it's electrical issue and referred me to one of his fried. i went there, he checked the car and said the oil pump is dead. i need to get the new oil pump + chain + silicon plus the labour charge will be 400 QAR around. I again was in search of some good and cheap mechanic this time too. so i visited 2-3 mechanics.. finally i found one, who found there is no oil pump issue. just need to clean the filter looking thing inside the chamber. He did that and the problem is solved in just 100 QAR again ! I don;t know how many problems i am gonna have in my car in future and how many crazy mechanic i will have to face. but after all, i can confidently say that, there is no honest mechanic in this city ! you have to check with 3-4 mechanic at least. or take your vehicle to authorized service center who definitely will charge you a lot !"	0	Q452	Q452_R31_C8

Rosette22 I contacted the person in hmc who sent my employment offer - my delay has been because the person in credentialing section did not send the report over to state that it has been completed. Luckily I had the email which states this so forwarded this to them. They are now applying for visa and stated that this takes between 3-4weeks.

A company is applying for a business visa for me to come to look at a potential new job - could someone please tell me approximately how long it should take for them to obtain the visa?	DHL is no longer processing for visa stamping. And it is too risky to exit to other Asian country and exit from there coming to Qatar, the immigration in other Asian countries are already informed about these back door exits, hence departure from there coming to other countries might be disallowed. If you're interested, send me message and I can give you the no. of an agent who is processing for deployment, meaning work visa will be processed thru POEA legally. He processed for my sister's work visa. Anyhow, you can try other means if you want to take the risk.	0	Q453	Q453_R32_C5

Hi, Being a direct hire from the Philippines entails a lot of head ache considering the red tape in Manila if could be very frustrating until the very end. With so many requirements to prepare and a lot more, chances are you will not be able to come to Qatar in just 30 days (if you are lucky enough). I am a Recruitment Officer in Doha and I bring people from Manila via the Bangkok route, meaning you book yourself as tourist to Bangkok (round trip ticket, a night stay in a hotel) and the following day you can board a plane to Doha. Honestly, we get nothing from the government not even a good service. SMS me and I will tell you this way, when you arrive in Doha, just register at the Polo Office.	0	Q453	Q453_R32_C6
A company is applying for a business visa for me to come to look at a potential new job - could someone please tell me approximately how long it should take for them to obtain the visa?	Kabayan, there are no more direct hire employees coming from the Philippines. There should be a job order filed by the employer through the Embassy here. This job order is to be given to an accredited recruitment agency. This is to assure and guarantee the safety of the employee to be hired. In short, there will be placement fees, pre-employment medical, PDOS, visa processing, etc. Cumbersome, time consuming but safe. The above comments pertains to getting here via a visiting visa or business visa. This is an option but personally, not advisable. You choice. Good Luck.	0	Q453	Q453_R32_C7

But if they advice you to extend it, go back to your agent who give you a visa and let them process it. But i'm sure you need to exit the country as per the info on above posts.	0	Q454	Q454_R14_C9

I have taken a family visit visa.As per visa;he should enter Qatar before 21.3.2015 (3 Months from issue date). Is it possible to extend the entry date? If so please explain the procedures....	so I hope QHell wont mind me tagging my query on to this thread and maybe will have the answer I'm looking for. I have invited my sister to visit us in Doha in January. I haven't booked her flight yet and know that we can obtain a 14 day visitor's visa for her on arrival at DIA. My question is this. If she would like to stay for, say, 3 weeks and so I book a return flight for that duration, what happens at DIA when she arrives with a return ticket dated 3 weeks after her arrival? I can see from QHell's post that it shouldn't be a problem to extend her Visa at the Airport AFTER her arrival but, if immigration see her visit is for THREE weeks, will they still issue her with a TWO week visa irrespective of what her ticket says? Grateful to anyone who may have the answer to this. QHell? What was the duration of YOUR visitor's return flight ticket, please. I guess it was for a stay longer than 2 weeks, otherwise you wouldn't have wanted to extend the Visa. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0	Q454	Q454_R31_C6

Are you talking about the visa or my sister's air ticket? I will purchase her ticket before we leave the UK and I'm trying to find out if it's OK to book her for a 3 week return ticket. It's my understanding that you can only get a Visa for 14 days on arrival, but then extend it later if you want to. What I'm asking is if it's OK to book her ticket for a 3-week return, even though the Visa will be for 14 days (initially). Will immigration query her ticket. Do you see what I mean? lol OH! And if you DO mean the ticket, then it would cost me a LOT more than QR100-200 to change the return date. I buy the cheapest ticket I can and those aren't 'changeable' unless you pay a lot of money to do so. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0	Q454	Q454_R31_C8

I have come here 3 times to visit my Husband beofe finally come here to live. Even though I told them I was here for 2 weeks holiday and my ticket had the return date on, each time at the airpot they automatically gave me a month visa. One of the times my Mum was with me & they also gave her a 1 month visa. So I would presure that they will automatically give your sister the same. Unless anyone else know different.

I have taken a family visit visa.As per visa;he should enter Qatar before 21.3.2015 (3 Months from issue date). Is it possible to extend the entry date? If so please explain the procedures....	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much.

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	Courrier Services Companies do not have to declare anything of a value less or equal to USD 2,500.

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	The service is good, reliable and let's say 4-5 times less expensive than their own shipping rates without this facility. First 1/2 kg costs you 8 dollars and it is 5.50 for each additional 1/2kg. Mind you, when it comes from US, the weight will be in pounds, so how they calculate the charge, beats me. The fact is that I have never paid more than 70 reals for my purchases from Amazon.com. Be careful, though, don't get your mailbox address on a junk mailing list, otherwise you will end up paying 8 dollars per each crappy catalogue or leaflet which will come on your name. I buy everything from Amazon.com (and most of the companies do sell through amazon.com) and nothing happened so far. Timewise it takes the package approximately 3-4 (rarely more than that) days to get to Doha, from the moment it arrives in your mailbox in US. UK takes 1-2 days. So far I am very happy with their service. My only complain is that they don't deliver, you have to go and fetch it yourself. But they do send you SMS, and there is tracking of items in your mailbox online. Check them at www.aramex.com/shopandship/ There is one more service www.ushopweship.com Supposedly they filter junk mail, but being happy with Aramex I have never tried them.	0	Q455	Q455_R1_C7

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company, but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content, like DVD's, VHS tapes, books, CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	0	Q455	Q455_R26_C4

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha, the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items, they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.	0	Q455	Q455_R26_C8

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	doha to dubai. first, you can ship one of the cars, i am told it will cost about 2K QAR/AED. you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi, and for this you will need a valid GCC residence visa. aside from this, i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here (but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here). if your car is too old you won't be able to register it in doha (i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year). no idea about the stuff but good question. i wanted to do the same, it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem.	0	Q455	Q455_R87_C1
Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	i just moved in here. if your visa will be cancelled come august, then i think you can no longer drive it i tried actually all the procedures. if you're planning to export it here through either recovery (trucking) or shipping (container) the first thing you'll do is go to Traffic department, the easiest and less crowded is the one near Al Wasl, 10am is a good time to go there. they will get your vehicle for export test and you have to pay for 25 dhs. then if you tell them you'll bring it to trucking company yourself, you'll pay around 80dhs for the export plates (blue plates) and they will get your old plates and also the registration of your vehicle (card), make sure too you cancel your salik, which has also a booth inside the building. here are the reminders: 1.) insist you'll take the car even with the blue plates, some of the guys will tell you to leave your car with them. with the blue plates, you can drive your car for 14 more days from the day you had the local plates canceled. 2.) look for shipping company, trucking company prior to having the car be exported so that they can process all the necessary documents. 3.) usually the shipping company asked for approximately 4000 dhs. plus 500 dhs documentation. this is for shipping (your vehicle will be in a container van, 1car/container) and aroun 2500-2900 dhs for trucking, someone will drive your car, or it will be on a trucking system. 4.) if you're visa is canceled, you cannot drive it going to qatar and passing through saudi, but if your visa is not canceled, you'll get the necessary visa to enter and exit saudi arabia and qatar. 5.) if your car is less than 2 years, you will be exempted from custom duty fee (tax) in qatar. you need though to get the certificate of exemption from your car's manufacturer or agent and they will charge you 500 dhs for a page. 6) if your car is more than 2 years and less than 5 years, you will be paying 5% of the current value of your car once you get to qatar. 7) cars more than 5 years are not allowed to be exported, thus leaving you no choice but to sell it. if you'll sell it, refer to number 1 procedure. hope these help. :)	0	Q455	Q455_R87_C2
Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	don't suppose you know about the other way? is it pretty much the same going from doha to dubai? just out of curiosity, if my qatar visa is not canceled, can't i just drive it to dubai and go to their ministry of transportation to register the car? thanks.	0	Q455	Q455_R87_C3
Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	Hi Cath, I'm also planning to take my car from Dubai to Doha. However, I have a couple of issues: 1. I just moved to Qatar a couple of weeks ago and haven't received my Resident Permit yet because they told me I have to cancel my Dubai visa first (even though it's my own investor visa) 2. I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar, will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it?

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	hi norman, i havent seen this posts and wasnt updated so i wasnt able to reply sooner. sorry, but i just replied to the poster as for my experience, with regard to questions you asked: 1.) they informed me before that all i have to show to the customs in Doha to claim my car if i send it to qatar is the working Visa the company gave me, not the RP in particular, though the thing i wasnt able to confirm, since i havent sent the car and instead sold it at last minute in UAE before i left. 2.) as ive mentioned too, the authorities informed me that i can never drive the car myself from UAE if my UAE visa is already canceled. on the canadian passport thing which you were asking, i dont know too if saudi borders let you obtain visa, last thing i know, it's US and israel passport holders they wont allow, but my friend here in doha told me, his friend with an american passport was able to enter saudi, so i cant help you with this info, apologies. but it is the driving with canceled visa that i was sure wont be possible, cause i tried that first time before i sold my car, and i was denied. 3.) what's the NOC for? 4.) they say 5% custom duty fee is applicable only to the cars manufactured over 2 years old. hope that helps and isnt late for the response yet.

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	I cant understand why people buy electronics in Qatar. I get all my stuff off of Amazon and have it shipped by Aramex. It costs me about 25% less even with the cost of shipping. Whatever you buy in Doha will be overpriced and out of date.

Can someone recommend a reliable shipping company to ship from Doha to Chicago	Online transactions are safe if you know your way around a pc. If your in doubt - use a pre paid credit card. I use aramex as well. The service is not all that great. They received two items from amazon on the same date and shipped one a week after the other. But amazon customer service is very good. You don't need to go their office to set up the account. You can register online from their website for a ship and shop account as well. Only reason why I would buy something from here over amazon/aramex is when I feel the local warranty is required or if I need it immediately.	0	Q455	Q455_R89_C5

Hi; I've been here for 6 months and I need to transfer my sponsorship; Is it possible? What is required? Thanks	From your comments I can see that there might be few issues. 1. Your new company might be over the slab of the nationality of your passport. So the MOI has deferred the approval for a later stage. 2. Your application might be deferred due to some missing papers but MOI has failed to update it on their portal. Kindly ask your PRO to check it with Gharaffa Immigration or else you can have the receipt and make a visit in the morning. 3. Also let me know whether you kept ur National PCC attested by Foreign affairs office or the CEID PCC from Qatar.

At present, and Jordanians, Syrians, Iraqis and a few other non-GCC nationalities have actually been being served deportation papers when trying to renew RP's in government positions or trying to get CID clearance. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""	0	Q456	Q456_R108_C9

'I'm American; master's degree; 4 years experience	for a pharmacist, that is the starting. but if you'll pass the exam here and got your own license then your salary will sure go up i think that is the plan of the employer...the agency told me that i should take a prometric exam and pass it before any process will continue...i did pass the prometric exam for pharmacy specialist......and im in the stage of data verification now.....i thought the prometric exam for pharmacy specialist which i took here in Manila ( online) is the qualifying exam but im not sure if it is? i tried to contact through email the department of SCH repsonsible for pharmacist but still i didnt receive any confirmation yet...so im not sure if I i would have to take another qualifying exams to get a license? Im not even sure if my salary will increase if i succeed in getting a license there..... BTW, im praying that a license pharmacist there in qatar join will notice and join this thread so that he/she could clear some important details from me......aside from salary offer....which is the main topic....	0	Q457	Q457_R17_C10

I know they do prescribe anxiety drugs, but you have to find a psychiatrist/psychologist to do that and they are rare here. There are no phone books, so you will have to find them by GP referral or word of mouth. I don't know about painkillers. They might have them here, but they might be something you have never heard of. Hope that helps a bit. Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )	0	Q457	Q457_R29_C1

Customs will send drugs to the Ministry of Health and you will have to go and pick it up. The BC pills you just go to a pharmacy and ask and they will get them for you.

Hey; What is the average salary for a pharmacist in Qatar? 'I'm American; master's degree; 4 years experience	@ han19 Thanks! Yeah, I think stress adds more to her problem that's why I told her that she must not think about the pimple problem because it will only add up. She also mentioned about the water in qatar, she said it's a bit different of what we have here in the Philippines. Whenever she takes a facial wash, she uses boiled water (cooled of course) for rinsing. The cosmetics that I would send her is recommended by a dermatologist, but unfortunately, our government won't allow it. @ kiarajane are you filipina? it looks like you're filipina because you know RDL, and Liwanag is a Filipino word... anyways, thanks for the reply...

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	greentea, it's not necessary, but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful! Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy. Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way. Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process. On the other hand, if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL, and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process, it shouldn’t be any issue with that.. but sometimes some unpredictable things happen.. here is the example. 5 points are given for the relatives in Canada. Let’s say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada. While filling in the application, the applicant adds 5 points to his score, and it helps him to get 67 points. But.. once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application. And then it turns out, that a sister doesn’t live in Canada at all. She lives, let’s say in her home country, Lebanon. And guess what, these 5 points “for sister in Canada” are taken out of the applicant's score. And then the applicant is left with only 62 points, which are not enough for the status of Immigrant. The case is refused and closed. This is only an example. There are a lot of different things and different issues. But again, if applicant is honest, and everything is clear and not doubtful, it shouldn’t be any problems.. I met one guy who wants to immigrate.. when I asked him what kind of education does he have, he said: high school. I said: there is no any chance for you. He said: oh, it’s not a problem.. I can get any Diploma, Degree, Certificates you want. I said: I don’t’ WANT you to get anything. I don’t want you to immigrate to Canada with this kind of “moral norms”, at the first place. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	"Honesty on the application is a different matter. Thats down to morals and common sense. A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful. If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site. If any questions arise the embassy will call you. Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews, these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries. A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $. Totally not worth it, Just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying.

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	You don't need any assistance (I did every thing by my self and many of my friends are there), especially for Canada. Canada migration fees are less, only 395 $ CA for you and 152 $ CA for each person with you. But according to what I get from Australia migration site, the fees are more than 2500 $ AUS. You have to make your choice between Canada : -20 deg or Australia a Hot country (but not hotter than Qatar I guess... :).. )	0	Q459	Q459_R27_C6

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	Small correction here, Eng & Avid;) Your company can issue you an exit permit, but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure, when your name is blacklisted in the system. If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque), obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.	0	Q459	Q459_R67_C8
Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	Apple I am not arguing with you. My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you, your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.	0	Q459	Q459_R67_C9
Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	"You got good points, and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police, you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly, the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff & the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan, Credit cards, Personal loans), then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly, only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is, if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases, nothing wrong to clear your name & follow up at the place where the charges against you were filed. This is to get assurance that you wont face any hassles in the airport Immigration during departure. Because....based on a friend experienced. She had a court case wherein the Baladiya filed against her for hanging clothes in the Veranda of her flat. It was located in the main road of Mughalina. She was fined QR500/ and manage to closed the case. But when she was supposed to leave emergency (her sister was serious), the Immigration Airport stopped her from leaving. Even if she told them ""i dont have any pending case and my sister is dying!"", still they dont listen for her as her name was blacklist in the system. Since it was Thursday evening, she needs to wait for 2 days till Sunday to go & clear her name from the system. In short, her sister died while she was still in Doha. She could have talked to her in her last moment:(((( I just wish it will never happen again to anyone among us!"	0	Q459	Q459_R67_C10

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	You will find that migration agents are usually in Australia. If they are in Qatar they may specialize in migration for many countries. If you use a migration business from Australia there are full service agents that you would speak with over the phone or email. They will be able to give you personal advice about which migration visa to choose. There are now lots of migration business's doing a DIY (do it yourself) process where you pay around $400 and receive an ebook that tells you how to complete the migration application yourself. Personally I consider this a ripoff to pay $400 for a book. I found a site called http://www.migrationinternational.com/ and they do a thing where you do not pay up front. They claim to personally do your application while chatting through email. And you pay once they have finished. I live in Philippines and I think I might use this site as I don't pay up front and at least they complete the application rather than me. What does everyone else think?	0	Q459	Q459_R70_C7

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law?

To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa, you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age, education level, profession, employment status, english proficiency, suitability, and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!	0	Q459	Q459_R124_C8

Honestly, I think nobody can do anything about it, unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money.

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region. It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts. For estafa or deceit, it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation, it will be filed with the Court of First Instance. You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer. But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit. If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience. Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants. Cases involving foreigners, civil or criminal are handled by regular courts.	0	Q459	Q459_R126_C8

Hello all; Can someone please recommend a law firm that can be trusted to deal with family/custody law? Thank you	the formality or informality of your document is immaterial.

If you parted goods or money based on his representations, and which you awfully trusted, and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back, and he reneged on this promise, then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa.	0	Q459	Q459_R126_C10

Regarding the starting salary,if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas, that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1,000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha, then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals.

Your teeth are an important part of your well being. So you should get the best. There are several dentists that do a good job, which includes Dr Sarrah's clinic. They use the right materials and do the right procedures. Ofcourse you can try a CHEAP place but remember, they are taking shortcuts some where.....and in the end you are paying for it. I was discussing with my dentist the fact that there were so many new dental clinics opening all over Doha and if this was a worry to him. He said that no way, he was not worried at all cos he said that he had heard from the medical rep that the first questions these new clinics were asking: ""What is the cheapest we can buy?"" This was in relation to equipment and materials.....so......do you want the cheapeststuff used on you? No not me, I rather go to a reputable dentist and get a good job/treatment. However the choice is your. And by the way I am not a patient of Dr Sarrah, but I know she is good, cos the good dentists hang around together and discuss cases. And Dr Sarrah is highly talked about by my own dentist. Aisha-Taweela"	0	Q460	Q460_R30_C5

My dentist (also not Dr. Sarah) has stated over and over how so few of the dental clinics in Doha practice sterilization of their instruments, have trained hygenists, up-to-date equipment etc..   That would scare me to death.   I would rather pay extra for these important points than risk my families health.  Be careful and ask more questions than just cost.  BTW  my daughter's braces--start to finish---cost 15,000 QR  for 1 year, twice the cost of her sisters  (2years -more difficult case) which were done in the states. 	0	Q460	Q460_R30_C6

Supreme Council of Health also dont know if you can pass either the evaluation or the exam.

They let you to take the exam becaause Evaluation results takes time to finished (sometimes more than 6months).

I want Qatar living update version	Its a wonderful device which I am sure you will love using Just ensure you buy the old version which can be unlocked very easily here. From my previous post -------------- All the US iPhones that came on week 45 and after have the 1.1.2 firmeware, with the new bootloader version 4.6. Those phones can still be jailbroken and activated, but there is no software sim unlock solution yet. To find out the week on your iPhone check the 4th and 5th digit of serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of box in which you received the iPhone. if it is 45 and above then there is no software solution to unlock the phone right now, Hardware solution TurboSim is your only option I guess. If you Serial number indicates that it is less that 45 then your iPhone can be unlocked. If not your choices are 1. Use TurboSim or similar HW method to unlock. 2. Jailbreak the iPhone and use it like iPod touch till a software unlock method is published. hope this helps --------------	0	Q461	Q461_R64_C4

I want Qatar living update version	You could ask for a phone whose manufacturing week is less than 45. ( which can be verified by the serial Number.) I wonder if apple stores will stock phones with less than 45 weeks manufacturing. You could try other sources besides apple as well. In the worst case apple iPhones are also available in Qatar except that they are slightly (or very) costly. As far as unlocking the phone is concerned have no worry.

I want Qatar living update version	yep american models are NTSC but 110v and the ones you buy here are NTSC and 110v or you can buy the asian version. You'll notice the difference from how they are packed. US versions have free games and the package is black, while asian version are somewhat ash and no free games,just the console and are 220v. About the NTSC or PAL. You really dont have to worry about it because newer TV systems Support both PAL and NTSC systems.

I want Qatar living update version	Yes Qatar has 220v. But dont worry, I suggest you buy a separate Power Supply for your PS3 which would likely be 110v if you're taking the US version PS3. Power Supplies are like boxes, like the ones you see under computers. Computers need a separate Power Supply. They both got 220v and 110v.

I want Qatar living update version	Contrary to what Qatari advises, the PS3 is region FREE. Meaning that any region game will work with the ps3. Having said that, i think there are DVD movie restrictions. The PS3's voltage doesn't matter either because they have built in regulators. I myself have a white Japanese PS3 (bought in Qatar) and it works perfectly find with everything. Just make sure you buy an HD cable if you have an HD tv since PS3's don't come with that. The Middle East's standard system is PAL. However you can get NTSC-J NTSC-UC and PAL all over in stores. I recommend the NTSC-UC (US, for movies because they come out later). At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what you get. ___________________________ Click here for LOADS of Qatar info  I♥Q  &lt;-- (Expat and Local Info)	0	Q461	Q461_R95_C10

I want Qatar living update version	I don't have a BB, and I also I'm not on Qtel ( as I'm in Saudi ! ) but there is a piece of software that I use called Joikuspot. This basically truns your smartphone into a wi fi hotspot and you can then connect any wireles device to it. You can get Joikuspot Light which is free, or you can pay for Joikuspot Premium. Obviously the Light version has restrictions, which the Premium version does not. Once you install and run it, the mobile phone will connect to the interent using the phone's data connection. You then connect the laptop and you're on line. THe problem you may have, if it is a company mobile, there may be restrictions on the handset allowing interent connectivity. Most mobile oeprators will allow for 3G data connections, but check your model of BB is 3G, some are only 2G ( Edge ) , e.g. BB Curve 8520 is only a 2G phone ( older models ) .	0	Q461	Q461_R140_C1

what is the new procedures and conditions for family status in Qatar or recruiting wife..??	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q462	Q462_R26_C4
what is the new procedures and conditions for family status in Qatar or recruiting wife..??	Please note after getting your RP you need NOC from hotel/sponsor of tourist visa for converting a tourist visa to family visit visa. This document is must.	0	Q462	Q462_R26_C5

what is the new procedures and conditions for family status in Qatar or recruiting wife..??	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q462	Q462_R26_C10

what is the new procedures and conditions for family status in Qatar or recruiting wife..??	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to, in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.	0	Q463	Q463_R46_C9

Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	Regarding the starting salary,if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas, that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1,000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha, then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future.

"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse, the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment, nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals, plus one for openning this year, in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor, if you will be assigned in al khor, your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home, not all patients know english.

"Dr S, I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital, and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1.

Anyway, there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program, you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board, HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam, the passing mark was 55. 3.

I was employed in Ras Gas for 3 years as a contractor. They have a good package for new direct employees. The housing is situated in Al Khor (70 km from Doha) they provide schooling in their complex. As a company Ras Gas are one of the main employeers in Ras Laffan. They are present extending their trains to 6 which will increase their production facilities.

If you have been employed directly to Ras Gas, then just do not think. Its the best company here in Qatar and they have all facilities. The accomodation complex is excellent and have all the features required. Yes, its a bit far from the Doha city. But that shouldnt be a problem. Nowadays Ras Gas are shifting some of their personnel to stay in Doha. Maybe after a few years you would be the lucky one. So dont think twice. Go ahead and do your planning to join the company.

Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	Hi McSunny, I have been offered a 3 year position in Ras Laffan with Qatar Gas, I will be living in Doha. It's a good offer and I will be on family status... Can you give me some general insight, GOOD & BAD. What are some of the day to day things that are frustrating to you, driving around Doha? the Drive to Ras Laffan? The heat in the summer? How are the people? What kind of leisure activites do they offer? Thanks! SloopJohnD	0	Q463	Q463_R101_C8
Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	Hi SloopJohnD, I have only lived here for a few weeks but will happily offer my humble opinion. I work on the Ras Laffan idustrial estate but not for QatarGas, so I cant give any opinions on QatarGas. It is based very near my company so the commute would be very similar - its not so bad, most of the way is easy - virtually the same road! Doha is the hardest part...the driving is crazy. With a family it is defitiely better to be living in Doha, everything you need is there and you can enjoy a good standard of living, all the schools are there too i think. The people seem ok, crime is very low and you never feel like you would walking the streets in other cities. There are lots of activities all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership. I cant speak for the heat in summer but I would imagine its quite unbearable - but with air con etc it should be fine - and the winter weather is meant to be glorious. There is a book which I got from amazon that came in useful called Qatar - the complete residents guide - that will give you lots of info and really is worth the money. One point which I didnt know is that you can upgrade your driving licence (in the uk anyway) for free to an international driving licence-you need to do it before you arrive. I dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but I would be happy to answer any questions. Doha is a good place to live and much better than anywhere near Ras Laffan, theres realy not alot there. Anyway, hope this helps. McSunny	0	Q463	Q463_R101_C9
Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	Hi. Thought I would give you my two cents worth. My husband had been driving back and forth to Ras Laffan for 8 months. He come to hate the drive! Although it is an easy ride once outside of city, straight highway driving. The drive takes between 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic of course. We moved to the new Dolphin Energy compound and really are enjoying it. Doha is close enough when we want to go into the city to do whatever. Compound life is awesome! Beautiful homes, almost like a small town within the compound! As for children well our youngest is 18 and they are living in Canada, so we didn't have to factor that into the move. However, I would think that compound living with children would be fine too. Certainly would not have to worry about day to day things that you would in a city. Hope this helped somewhat.	0	Q463	Q463_R101_C10

Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said, saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	0	Q463	Q463_R109_C5
Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them, we had one woman for a while, but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness, we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris, but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs, and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."	0	Q463	Q463_R109_C6

Supervisor profession and General Supervisor profession in Qatar ID; which is eligible for family permanent visa ????	"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first, second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where, if somebody screws up, there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

When I inquired, they said it was technical fault. This amount was adjusted after several calls & e-mails; 4) After few years, I went to the bank and requested to close my account. After the paper work, I asked to give receipt/letter for confirmation that the account was closed. She said in order to get the receipt/letter I need to pay cash.

Anyone tell me how many days for QID to renew?	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q465	Q465_R72_C4

Anyone tell me how many days for QID to renew?	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q465	Q465_R72_C10

Anyone tell me how many days for QID to renew?	Mine was rejected because of Qatarization issues. Since the company I am joining is not meeting its target, the Ministry of Labour decided to block most of its overseas hiring, therefore mine was blocked. It took them around 9 days to issue the rejection, and then 4 more days to change their mind when my company submitted a letter inviting them to review the situation. What I would say is that your application is stuck with the CID normally. It might take them few more days to process your papers. In the meantime ask your company if this is normal. If they tell you this is fine you do not need to worry about it then it is fine. The only problem would be to manage your situation financially during this time, as I assume you are now paying your own rent.	0	Q465	Q465_R144_C9

Visas on arrival (100 QR) can be renewed once (for an additional 100QR) then you have to leave the country and return (Bahrain Air has fares in the range of 411 QR). I'm not sure if a tourist visa obtained through a hotel can be renewed though. You can try renewing it at the Immigration Office near the airport. If you do, great, if not, Bahrain has a great First Class lounge--far surpassing the public bus terminal called the Silver Lounge at DIA.	0	Q466	Q466_R14_C3
hi; I would like to know the maximum no of days for visit visa? i am n visit visa from this aug.i have visa till jan end..will i be able to extend it more than that? If so; how many months?	"Hi! I got here a month ago and my visa( it must have been a tourist visa) should expire tomorrow. Since my husband has an RP and he lives here I gave his address until I apply for an RP under his sponsor. Since his sponsor had to leave the country on family vacation I didn't have time to process the RP. We thought we might try our luck and see if we could get my visa extended and thank God it worked. We went to the ministry of interior building which is across the street from the parking lot( all the way back) with another name on it called passport and airport security. First we went to the airport( arrival)section where they have an immigration place but I think since it was like 5.00pm it was closed. Anyway we asked at the information counter about visa extention and she directed us even from where she stood to a building behind the ""Click"" billboard across the street from the airport. So we went there. Within the vicinity there are 2 or 3 smaller buildings for specificic travel needs. Go to the visa section. The actual counters for visa was closed but apposite those counters is a travel permit counter ( no.2) you can extend your visa there provided you have a debit or visa credit card to pay QR100 for the visa. It was pretty easy. They'll put a sticker with your name and 1 month visa on it. We were so happy we wanted to tell everyone about it. Until we get the RP process underway we have some peace of mind. Thanks to all those people who have provided some information on visa extension on qatarliving. It's a great site. Anyway I am looking for DEWALT cordless drill batteries and board or wood that I can buy here in Qatar. Does anyone know where I can purchase them?"	0	Q466	Q466_R14_C4

hi; I would like to know the maximum no of days for visit visa? i am n visit visa from this aug.i have visa till jan end..will i be able to extend it more than that? If so; how many months?	so I hope QHell wont mind me tagging my query on to this thread and maybe will have the answer I'm looking for. I have invited my sister to visit us in Doha in January. I haven't booked her flight yet and know that we can obtain a 14 day visitor's visa for her on arrival at DIA. My question is this. If she would like to stay for, say, 3 weeks and so I book a return flight for that duration, what happens at DIA when she arrives with a return ticket dated 3 weeks after her arrival? I can see from QHell's post that it shouldn't be a problem to extend her Visa at the Airport AFTER her arrival but, if immigration see her visit is for THREE weeks, will they still issue her with a TWO week visa irrespective of what her ticket says? Grateful to anyone who may have the answer to this. QHell? What was the duration of YOUR visitor's return flight ticket, please. I guess it was for a stay longer than 2 weeks, otherwise you wouldn't have wanted to extend the Visa. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0	Q466	Q466_R125_C6

hi; I would like to know the maximum no of days for visit visa? i am n visit visa from this aug.i have visa till jan end..will i be able to extend it more than that? If so; how many months?	Are you talking about the visa or my sister's air ticket? I will purchase her ticket before we leave the UK and I'm trying to find out if it's OK to book her for a 3 week return ticket. It's my understanding that you can only get a Visa for 14 days on arrival, but then extend it later if you want to. What I'm asking is if it's OK to book her ticket for a 3-week return, even though the Visa will be for 14 days (initially). Will immigration query her ticket. Do you see what I mean? lol OH! And if you DO mean the ticket, then it would cost me a LOT more than QR100-200 to change the return date. I buy the cheapest ticket I can and those aren't 'changeable' unless you pay a lot of money to do so. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0	Q466	Q466_R125_C8

I have come here 3 times to visit my Husband beofe finally come here to live. Even though I told them I was here for 2 weeks holiday and my ticket had the return date on, each time at the airpot they automatically gave me a month visa. One of the times my Mum was with me & they also gave her a 1 month visa. So I would presure that they will automatically give your sister the same. Unless anyone else know different.

I'm a doctor from Tunisia and I consider applying for a job in Qatar. I learned so much about Qatar from this cool website, there's so much useful information but, just like dr S i guess, nowhere could I find something specific about salaries, allowances for doctors, nurses, dentists working at the HMC or elsewhere (private hospitals, Al Ahli, American hospital. I know it all might depend on the country of citizenship, the degrees... but it could be nice to have at least an idea about what to expect, some raw numbers...

hi Need an Visit or Business visa for Indian national and want stay for 3 month; and how much it cost;	"Dr S, I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital, and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon, therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway, there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program, you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board, HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam, the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8,200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications, you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."	0	Q467	Q467_R40_C8

Hi All; How to get an Umrah visa from doha. I want to travel by plane. And perform Umrah by my self. I would be thankful for any response given Thanks	I know this is an old thread, but I am replying just in case it helps somebody later on. For the Singapore visa, go to Overseas travels(near Grand Hamad Street aka Bank Street). There is a Singapore Airlines counter there. You need the following 1) Your passport 2) 1 photo with a blue background and shows your face and ears clearly. You can get the application form from there. Fill it and give it to the guy there. They will give you the visa in 3,4 days. The visa costs 120 QR. I think they take an additional 10 QR. We applied for the visa, and I got 5 weeks Multiple entry, while my wife and kid got 2 years multiple entry:)	0	Q468	Q468_R66_C8

If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way, apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification, now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit. Some times Free visa holders stuck in this country and you may never meet your sponsor after you arrive in this country and may not get Exit permit to go for vacation or Emergency situation.	0	Q468	Q468_R127_C8

Hi All; How to get an Umrah visa from doha. I want to travel by plane. And perform Umrah by my self. I would be thankful for any response given Thanks	i have similar experience with German embassy. Although i am not a German, but the staffs in German embassy (who i know for a fact is not  a German) also just 'smirked' at me when i tried to applied for a schengen visa for visiting Finland. I have to go back and forth lets say about 5 times, then i probably lucky on my 5th time the non-German woman not working and a German lady served me with smile and was really helpfull. I later told this story to some of my US friends over here, and almost everyone of them laughed at me, saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is, if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA, he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for. An Indian can't apply for a US visa in Qatar. This is what the [this post has broken our guidelines by using bad language - you will be removed from QL if this continues] at the Embassy told me after I refused to leave until I got an answer. Whether this is true or not I can't tell you. However: If this is true, why do the guards at the front gate, who do the pre-interview, allow us to go in and pay that money? It is almost like a scam to get money. I never set foot on the US in my life before. So in this case, i have to fly all the way to Jakarta and applying visa from there? I know the UK embassy  have a similar rules, you have to show the local resindent permit in order to apply visa from the said country. I have managed to get a UK visa from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore British Embassy with no problems. The one in Kuala Lumpur didn't even ask to see my local RP, the one in Singapore did the opposite (wont even look my application without seeing my local RP)... but that was before 9/11.  I found out these non-western people who work for western embassy are rather arrogant ...

No matter what papers you will provide (bank statements showing that you can spend there $10,000 in 1 week or undertaking letter from your job that they guarantee your return), by the way dutchess01 no matter who is your sponsor in Qatar either...For example, if you are egyptian/lebanese/syrian (or indian/srilankian/philipino, etc...) single guy of 25-26 y.o...or so.. then FORGET ABOUT IT.. unless you are sooo much lucky… and if you DO get a visa by the chance, it's a very rare exception rather than the rule. sometimes they even reject to give a visitor's visa to the spouse of the american or canadian citizen...it's also pretty common practice... so guys relax and go to Maldives for your vacation...lol.... the only Company who can get a visa to US (the business one)relatively easy is Microsoft, as these guys are supported by Bill Gates..lol... *********************** [img_assist|nid=71431|title=This Too Shall Pass|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]	0	Q468	Q468_R135_C5

Embassy in Qatar, but unfortunately, my prospective qatari employer refused to abide by this procedure and instead, they send me the above mentioned new workvisa, they also adviced me instead to travel first to singapore or hongkong as tourist, then travel to doha. will the immigration officers in singapore/hongkong allow me to exit/travel to doha, qatar even though the workvisa is not stamp on my passport?	0	Q468	Q468_R140_C9

Hello;i just came back in Qatar and learned that needs UPDA certificate for engineers to apply.Can i take UPDA exam while im still under family visit visa? Pls advise.	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case, you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB), so i think it wont take long that much.

Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status...? Maybe what the company meant was they accept applicants or workers only for those with husband visa sponsorship...Anyway look for company which can provide a working visa, if you do have more time. Good luck and God bless on your job hunt!	0	Q469	Q469_R29_C1

Hello;i just came back in Qatar and learned that needs UPDA certificate for engineers to apply.Can i take UPDA exam while im still under family visit visa? Pls advise.	Families of sponsored residents may enter Qatar on a short-term Family Visit Visa. The visa is valid for one month. However, relatives who wish to stay beyond one month may undergo a physical examination within the first 72 hours of arrival to apply for an extension. The visa can be extended to cover a maximum of six months only (five extendable months for immediate family members and two months for second-degree relatives).	0	Q469	Q469_R29_C3

Hello;i just came back in Qatar and learned that needs UPDA certificate for engineers to apply.Can i take UPDA exam while im still under family visit visa? Pls advise.	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Hello Everyone; I am working in Qatar as Accountant; i want to bring my wife and 4 months old son to Qatar on visit visa. Please tell me the procedure to follow.	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken, you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more, then after that, you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days, then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly, apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice, finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only, not extendable so they have to go out the country.	0	Q470	Q470_R3_C4

Hello Everyone; I am working in Qatar as Accountant; i want to bring my wife and 4 months old son to Qatar on visit visa. Please tell me the procedure to follow.	I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank, you need Rent agreement, your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also), you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.	0	Q470	Q470_R3_C10

Hello Everyone; I am working in Qatar as Accountant; i want to bring my wife and 4 months old son to Qatar on visit visa. Please tell me the procedure to follow.	Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Please tell me the procedure to follow.	tahsinmim, he is asking contract for visit visa not family visa (RP) and the baladiya stamp is not needed, if he is applying for family visa that time baladiya stamp is required and since he is living in a villa then he will need too many papers from all parties. he can get the required documents for the attestation from the baadiya his area belongs to.	0	Q470	Q470_R71_C4

I got an offer in QA with 10000 QAR including accommodation.I am single. I am thinking of getting a car second hand also.So what what be your suggestion.	Depends, If you are Western educated than the salary for 18 years experience with MBA is way too low. It should be in the range QAR 40000-45000 (including accomodation). A new villa in a compound will cost you QAR 12,500 upwards. Make sure that you move in a brand new place since quality of accomodation is pretty lousy. Note that Doha is a pretty dull place and does not offer the expat life available in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.	0	Q471	Q471_R4_C2

I got an offer in QA with 10000 QAR including accommodation.I am single. I am thinking of getting a car second hand also.So what what be your suggestion.	British, MBA, 18 years of experience and 18000 that is too low. I don't recommend. to enjoy your stay at Qatar, you should get an apartment in a compound. You will never find any for less than 10,000 QAR. Cost living for two expats persons is minimum 4000 QAR. to Rent a good, not luxury, car you need at least 2000 QAR. The Insurance should be provided by the company. As I see at Qatar, British with 18 years of experience is getting around 50,000 QAR as a basic salary.	0	Q471	Q471_R4_C8

I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer, but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser, beautician, etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0	Q471	Q471_R6_C10

Am a Qatari with 4 persons in my family n I sure spend more than 1000 a week on grocery, even though I am on a continues diet :P.

I have a friend with a wife n 4 kids who always brags about spending no more than 1000 a month on all groceries. But that's done by waking up at 5 AM n driving to the industrial area or the farms to buy the veggies n meat n the waterfront to buy fish.

"you could set appointment by bringing the copy of receipt and then they will put the date and time on it. in my case, the appointment was set 1 month after I requested for the meeting. so many reasons why application is rejected. if they have problem on your papers they will tell you, if that can still be supported by providing other documents, then they might put the status under ""postpone"" while waiting for your other papers. They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here.

Hi leo55699, Qatar Airways (like other organizations) has its grade structure. It consists of 11 grades. I don't know the whole structure but understand that 8-11 are managerial grades. I also received an offer from them (we may joined the same interview section in Central ...). Their offer letter didn't say much background details and I kept clarifying with them. Suggest that you do the same to clear your concerns. P.S.: Personal thought is that you can definitely find a job with a more decent salary package than this in HK now.

Since i am going finally from qatar; i want to cancel the RP of my Family who are under my sponsorship. Can anyone suggest what is the procedure ?	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However, the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4, any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However, this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior, or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor, according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Which bank is the good bank for personal banking i am looking for a bank which provides good customer service. I had experience with Commercial Bank and Doha Bank; both are not so great	Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB, you have to have a minimum of Qr 3,000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus, you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful, read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.	0	Q473	Q473_R4_C10

If everything's hunky dory, you'll be fine but the minute there's trouble, don't hold your breath. My beard would have grown several miles long before they even get moving. Quick transfer of funds, did you say? Is 3 days quicker than other banks? As for the extensive network thingy - I can't link with my HSBC back home.

HSBC, gimme back my money!! /I called both the dispensing ATM and HSBC as well. Both logged in my complaint.

Whats the scheduled time for corniche fire works?	"We reached Cornish at 6 PM. Nothing except huge crowed. They put 3 TV and there was nothing to show. All the time showing sea, some dead man, old houses, fire etc. At least they should have broadcasted morning event or some dignitaries meeting and wishing other dignitaries. Only entertainment was that an old gentle man was asked by police to move away from some area as it was for the family but that man refused to move and there was long argument. The man flatly refused stating that where it is written “reserved for the family"" He also called 2 ladies and asked if they have any problem if he sits here. Ladies told No, He then asked police that if ladies have no problem then what your problem is. You being a man, you should also move and keep lady police in family zone. The police man got fed up and left the place but police man was good and never lost tamper. Realized that quarrel or argument can also be entertaining and good times pass. Even some helicopter was flying; every one was looking at that. Overall it was not very exciting, just watching crowed and children. Fire cracker show at 8 PM was fantastic.

Whats the scheduled time for corniche fire works?	all I can say is that,I drove up to and on part of the Corniche ealier today, and yes I saw police and security men stopping people walking to the corniche. It seemed fine to just park up in a car. Noticed most of the people they were stopping were groups of men. Today for many was a well earned rest day, to spend time with family and friends. I can only assume that 'someone' was going to travel on the corniche and 'they' did not want them to see the reality of Qatar - hard workers (I do have to admit it did seem like security were stopping only labour men in their casual clothes) who on a day off wish to do nothing than walk innocently on the corniche with friends.

Whats the scheduled time for corniche fire works?	Your Qatari amnesia? Says it all if your response if yes. So if you’re not married or part of a family you cannot enjoy Eid celebrations on the corniche? The fact that you think this is normal on such a special occasion (something everyone should enjoy regardless of religion, race, marital status) reflects what an uncaring person you are. They were doing the same at the airport the other night where there were huge queues. They would not let Asian workers say goodbye to their families, with police officers actually hitting some people yelling “yalla,yalla.” Qataris were able to say goodbye to their loved ones. Why is that? As well Qataris were jumping the queues, with no one saying a word as they were too scared. Would love to see that happen anywhere else outside the Gulf!! Of course it has to do with being Qatari. You’re telling me that if a single Qatari male walked to the corniche he would have been stopped? Or if a VIP walked, they would have been stopped? Yeah right!! People can criticize westerners as much as they want, but at least at Christmas, EVERYONE regardless of religion, race, marital status are able to attend mass and are not discriminated against.

Whats the scheduled time for corniche fire works?	As much as I sympathize with the labours and all, but sometimes their presence is very uncomfortable. Two days ago, I went to the airport to pick up a friend and when I walked in, it was like they've never seen a female before, I just wanted to crawl into a hole and hide, it was VERY uncomfortable having all those men gawk...ekkhhh! So actually I would like a day at the corniche where I could go and not worry about men looking at me like a piece of meat. I remember when they had the fireworks for the 2016 Olympics bid and I was there, and the amount of labours staring as we walked...MY GOD! So I guess the security has the families in their best intentions and I can see why they would stop certain groups from going to the corniche.
